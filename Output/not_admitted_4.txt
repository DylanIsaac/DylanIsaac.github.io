<p>Seriously&#8230; I built my own watch. I folded 1000 paper boats as a prank. I got a 35 on the ACT. I led my school&#8217;s debate team in its first year; we sent two squads, got 1st and 2nd place. I won my school&#8217;s history fair my sophomore year. I got a 5 on AP Calc BC, independently studied. I recorded three CDs of experimental music. I was the third highest scorer in the city in Academic Decathlon, and the highest in math, economics, and essay. I&#8217;m currently leading Chicago&#8217;s CCML (City of Chicago Math League) senior standings by 7 full points. I went to the Ross mathematics camp. I even snuck into MIT&#8217;s freshman orientation for the class of &#8217;12 and pretended to be a freshman.</p>

<p>LSK, MIT is looking for people who are well rounded. You don&#8217;t have to be one of the top 5 pianists in the world either. That helps but its not necessary. Your math/academic creditials sound awesome, but the problem is that somebody else might be just as good as you at math and they also do sports/community service/boy scouts/student government too. Being a prodigy in one area will not get you in.<br />

<p>And if not, it&#8217;s all right. MIT isn&#8217;t the only good place in the Universe, and if they rejected you it&#8217;s probably because you wouldn&#8217;t have been happy there anyway. If you&#8217;re really in love with MIT you can always apply for Grad school, which is even better on a job application.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think a lot of people understand what goes into this admissions process.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily whether you&#8217;re &#8220;better&#8221; than the next guy, or even more &#8220;well-rounded&#8221;. Literally (and every college I&#8217;ve ever visited says this), they just are trying to make a well-rounded CLASS.</p>
<p>Maybe they need a good musician. They get to your application, and music is the one thing you don&#8217;t do. So they defer you, and accept the guy with worse grades but who is also a musical prodigy.</p>
<p>Also, remember that if you&#8217;re Caucasian (this might even apply to Asians), the Affirmative Action program might have been the reason you got denied; whether you think it&#8217;s &#8220;ethical&#8221; is a discussion for a different time, but just know that MIT does promote its Affirmative Action program and so that could very well have been a factor.</p>
<p>The point is, there are so many factors that go into admissions. It literally is the luck of the draw. Everyone who was smart enough to apply to MIT in the first place will get accepted to another top-tier school. Maybe Harvard or Princeton isn&#8217;t looking for that musician right now, so you&#8217;re the next great candidate. You weren&#8217;t denied because you weren&#8217;t smarter or more well-rounded than the other guy. You were denied because you probably just weren&#8217;t what they still had a need for when they read your application.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that MIT doesn&#8217;t have policies in place for minority admissions, but Affirmative Action is not one of them. Even if it were, that wouldn&#8217;t mean that a less-qualified minority candidate were accepted in your place; at colleges practicing Affirmative Action, given the choice between two candicates with near-identical credentials in their application &#8211; one of whom is a minority &#8211; you accept the minority candidate.</p>

Usually, for college, there is a set percentage range of certain minorities that they hope to accept, and they try to fit those guidelines.

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Ok. I am applying RD, and haven&#8217;t failed yet. I don&#8217;t expect to get in&#8230;But I&#8217;m not letting that stop me.</p>
<p>My friend Brit last year was dead-set on going to Georgetown. She had spent her whole childhood dreaming of that school&#8211; When we met, it was at a GU summer program. Last year she applied ED and got rejected. She is amazing; she has braces on her legs, but is the most independent and loving person I know. She is an amazing poet and has won many national contests, in addition to perfect grades. Safe to say, she was heartbroken. Then she gor accepted to Howard RD, and got a full-ride scholarship. She is so happy now, and relieved that she is where she should be. She knows that.</p>
<p>So, this probably feels like the end of the world, but you know what? Everything works out for the best (Voltaire would have a hay-day right now <img src="https://mitadmissions.org/images/smileys/raspberry.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="raspberry" style="border:0;" />). When you resign yourself to accepting the things you can&#8217;t change, and pick yourself up, good things happen and you find yourself where you should be. Call it karma, Fate, God, whatever.</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;ll all find yourselves somewhere, even if it isn&#8217;t at MIT. <img src="https://mitadmissions.org/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></p>

I know it&#8217;s not much consolation now, but you&#8217;ll go on to other perfectly good colleges and do extraordinary things (I can tell by all of your accomplishments). And anyway, you will always have the journey to remember. Because if it were only about the destination, the end would be anticlimactic, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I managed to venture into here&#8211;maybe I miss the excitement of college admissions&#8211;but either way, this makes me think of what Sadoway of 3.091 told us in his last lecture right before finals&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the worst that can happen? You fail one class, you fail two, three classes, you fail ten classes, and then you leave this place. It&#8217;s no big deal. I went to the University of Toronto, and look at me&#8211;I&#8217;m still here.&#8221;</p>
<p>(btw, Sadoway is a super accomplished materials scientist. Look him up.)</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to hear this, but after being here a semester, this place is NOT the best place in the world, it&#8217;s NOT candyland for knowledge and nerds, and it&#8217;s certainly NOT what I thought it would be. There are tons of good schools, even better than here. I love MIT, but don&#8217;t sweat it. (Also, there&#8217;s always grad school!)</p>

<p>The thing about being rejected that disapoints me the most is that they told us about the size of the applicant pool as if it were a comfort. That just makes us all feel medeocre. But, to whoever writes those things, rejected applicants would much rather here what made them an inadequit fit for MIT. I want to know the real reason why. I want to know why I wasn&#8217;t good enough to at least get deffered. I don&#8217;t want to be told that MIT is sorry, I just want an answer as to why I got rejected.</p>
<p>To all of you talking about you&#8217;re accomplishments. I bet you&#8217;ll do great things. If you got rejected, their loss.</p>

<p>@LSK: I may be biased but your achievements don&#8217;t really stand out from the crowd. You have plenty of them, but remember that you&#8217;re going against many people with many accomplishments too.</p>
<p>My friend got accepted because she&#8217;s one of the best pianists in the world (won 5 international compos this year). Now that&#8217;s something that truly stands out.</p>

<p>No offense to some of you guys who have listed your laundry lists of &#8220;accomplishments&#8221;, but MIT IS a competitive school to get admitted into; however, that doesn&#8217;t mean you guys are competing against each other. You are competing against yourself. And I&#8217;m pretty certain that most of the applicants are extraordinary students, however, just because you didn&#8217;t get admitted doesn&#8217;t mean you are dumb or not capable of achieving success in your life. It just means that, based on the things you said in your apps, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to match the lifestyle, resiliency, and hard work that is needed here. Also, if you tried to be or sounds like someone else on the application, that might have been the reason for your rejection.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just my 2 cents here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;m really sorry to hear that you guys didn&#8217;t make it. It sucks, yes. But this is not the end of the world. Pick it up and move on.</p>
<p>To all of you who got in, congrats!! I hope I&#8217;ll join the celebration once the rest of the decisions start rolling out in March.</p>

<p>Trust me, it could be worse. You could have a 5.112 test in 3 hours.</p>
