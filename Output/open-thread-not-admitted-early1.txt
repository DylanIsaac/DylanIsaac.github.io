<p>As a parent, it saddens me to see the posts<br>stating that because you were rejected, your life is not worth living<br>anymore.  I understand that some of you come from families or countries<br>where you may be led to believe your success or failure as a person is solely<br>dependent upon the college you get into or where you are hired. I am so<br>sorry that you have taken that message to heart.</p><p>I don't know if any of you will read this, but I'd like<br>to tell you a story. I hope it's not too long, but I also hope it helps even<br>one person.  I grew up very, very poor in a small town, we were on<br>food stamps and I stood behind a gov't truck to get cheese because my mom was<br>too embarrassed.  My husband grew up in the projects outside NYC. School came<br>pretty easy to me, and yes, it was "a different time" as far as<br>college was concerned.  We didn't have SAT test practice sessions and<br>tutors- the first time I walked in to take the test is the first time any of us<br>saw it.  We could take it one more time to try to better the score. (Can<br>you imagine?) Getting over a 600 was considered a great score. My husband, on<br>the other hand, was more interested in girls and partying than going to class<br>and trying- until his Senior year, when he decided he was tired of being poor<br>and wanted to become a doctor.</p><p>I got into the only college I applied to, and received a<br>decent scholarship, too. But, I had to take out a loan and my mother kinda'<br>freaked out about me going into debt, so I was forced to transfer to a state<br>school. Meanwhile, my husband did not get into his first choice public school,<br>but did get accepted into the only other one to which he applied. Which he then<br>promptly nearly failed out of with a 2.1gpa.  He transferred to an obscure<br>4 year school near his father's house, which had just decided to change<br>from an all-girls college and was desperate for boys, so they gave<br>him a chance. He lived with his Dad until he proved he would work harder.<br>He ended up graduating summa cum laude and was accepted into medical<br>school. He graduated again with honors, and is now a surgeon.  Through<br>many years of hard work, he and his partners have opened multiple offices and<br>he makes 3-4 times the national average for surgeons.  He is one of the<br>most successful of his high school class.  I went to school on and off,<br>working to pay my tuition. I am an Accountant.</p><p>We have several homes, take nice vacations, have great<br>kids and no, my son did not get accepted into MIT.  So it has nothing to<br>do with your ability to pay, because I never even filled out any FAFSA, so MIT<br>doesn't know that we can pay in full. (My other children did not get into their<br>dream #1 school either, and believe me they are all doing fine.)</p><p>The lesson is that you<br>can make it no matter where you go.  As I said, I know times have<br>changed.  But lots of great and successful people are out there in the<br>world, and MIT, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Cal Tech, etc. is not in<br>any of their stories.  You are only 17, 18 or 19.  Your life story<br>has only started.  Please don’t give up already.  There is no guarantee that an elite education<br>will make you a successful person, either. <br>So, don’t stop believing in yourself.</p>

<p>You know what I hate about college decisions in in the U.S.? It's not just your scores they look at, like they do in Canada and other countries. They don't turn you down for something as objective as that. No, you put in your self, your personality, the things you care about, you tell them things maybe even some of your friends don't know, and that's what they decide on. MIT looked at who I am and decided that wasn't good enough. That there were other people whose personality they thought was more interesting and more worthy than mine. I realize logically that schools may  have to do this, especially when they are very competitive. But I think it's really messed up to rank young human beings through a bunch of subjective measures, then say that one small group objectively deserves more than the others. I'm not the most interesting, most talented person in the world, but I don't like that my very self is what MIT turned down, not just a bunch of random numbers. It may be a needed evil, and I realize that, but I find it hypocritical how personable and kind the bloggers here are, how much they seem to care about the individual, when the whole college admissions system is spitting in the face of people's individual and subjective worth. (Which is not to blame the individual cogs that need work in this system so that choices can be made about MIT students--the problem is more sociological/systematic and can be even seen as a national weakness in our way of assessing people's worth).</p><p>Maybe that doesn't make complete sense, but I would say that is one of the factors which makes this decisions painful. Hopefully others will understand what I am getting at. Other things, like objective talent in mathematics, can be ranked with a reasonable degree of certainty by looking at intensity of classes, SAT and ACT scores, or participation in some other math test. But  to look at questions as private as what you do for fun, what are challenges you have faced, etc., and decide from that.... What this teaches me is that I should never rank people in this way, and that I should not rank myself this way. Because that is something I hope I will never do to another person.  Other rejected students reading this: who you are as a person is good and worthy, and screw the system that forced some other human being to decide that you weren't. You will do great things with your virtues and the great love you feel. You worked really hard, and I am sure that will somehow pay off. Even if feels like it didn't, know privately that you do deserve so much, that your sacrifices are impressive, that you are impressive and important.</p>

<p>The post on the first page is right about you. Why don't you do something more constructive with your life?  You have proved MIT was right to NOT have accepted you. You would have fought and argued with every professor unless they saw how "great" you were and gave you the scores "you deserve!"  So- I've never seen you post one wonderful thing you've done to better mankind.  No one takes your posts seriously anyway.  You are like a gnat.  Most the time I don't even read your comments.  Lydia said it best- we will just parade through your rain.

<p>Thank you very much for your reply. Your advice is wise and perfectly sound.</p><p>I am in a non-traditional situation. Unlike most undergraduate applicants, I am a 30-year-old man, so college has already been on hold for some time now. In the meantime, I plan to bootstrap a business (or two… or ten), so I won’t be putting my life on hold. I was going to do this anyway, so in a way, it’s good that I’ve been rejected, because it will allow me more time to focus on building up my finances. Hopefully, within a year or two, I won’t even need to apply for financial aid when reapplying to the Institute.</p><p>In fact, I think I CAN substantially improve my application. All of my math &amp; science SAT scores were about one or two hundred points lower than what you would think of as “normal” for an MIT applicant. I know I can bring those up substantially with more self-study, and consequently be more prepared for the workload at MIT. On the other hand, this policy of “sorry, we can’t give feedback” leaves me wondering if that would even matter. Like, even if I pulled a 2400, with 800s on every available Subject Test, the admissions readers could still decide that I’m just not that interesting a mountain climber. So that’s frustrating.</p><p>I left high school early, because I felt that I could do better by taking my education into my own hands. I passed the proficiency exam and left after 10th grade (unfortunately leaving behind some pretty poor grades). My plan was to become a game developer. After detours working in web development and photo post-production, and a lot of sitting around at night contemplating the Universe, I began to discover that what I really want to do is improve the built environment. In short: we’ve been doing a poor job of architecture and city planning for the past several decades, and I think that solving this meta-problem would solve a lot of other problems automatically (if very slowly). Unlike game development, where some of the best and brightest never went to college at all, the business of building is one in which you really do, by law, need a degree. And as much as I disliked high school, I had never ruled out college as an option, so I decided it was finally time to go.</p><p>I only applied to MIT. One thing I do share with others here is a deep sense of knowing exactly where I belong. MIT is the epicenter of that “hacker” spirit that I’ve always identified with so much. (In a slightly different Universe, where I stayed in school, did well, and went straight into MIT, I would have done Course VI, no question.) On top of that, it is fairly unique in its combination of world-class instruction in the various disciplines I’m interested in: civil &amp; environmental engineering, architecture, urban planning, economics, real estate development. It is top-ranked in every one of these. There are other schools that excel in one or more, but none that excel in all of them, in combination, the way that MIT’s departments do. It’s not like the difference between doing CS at MIT vs Carnegie Mellon. Plus, you know… it’s MIT, where all kinds of fun, creative things happen. I’m going to continue running into the acronym “MIT” on an almost daily basis, just because my interests bump up against the Institute’s so very often. For example, just this past month, I’ve been doing a lot of cool art in Processing, a project that was started at the MIT Media Lab. I’m not running into quite so many cool, innovative things made at Berkeley or UIUC. (Although… I guess we can credit them with BSD and NCSA Mosaic. Still, you get my point.) It’s MIT-this, MIT-that in the world of creative, humane engineering. How could I apply anywhere else?</p><p>Thank you, Lydia, for taking the time to reply and offer so much encouragement to those of us in this thread. I honestly felt better after reading your many comments. YOU are amazing, and YOU will do amazing things.</p>

<p>mr. peterson, in the past mit was the greatest, it contributed greatly to the industrialization, to providing technology during world wars, and to the first moon missions, etc, today it functions ..but nothing substantial. and please don't show us those statistics, i've seen students at mit, that 10% your admission committee selects from the pool, they are immature and clearly lacking in character! go through your archives n take a look at the "mit: the motion picture" from 1992, now look at the videos made more recently, they have no appeal to them whatsoever! There is no way the present mit community can come up with something that is remotely as cool as what was done in the past. There WAS a time when mit was the best in the world, but it NO LONGER is. In 1949 baker house was built, it was one of the finest pieces of architecture, what do you have now? simmons hall ..all i can say is that building's an eyesore from inside out! and you spent 78 million dollars on that ugly building. The world does not always move in the right direction..</p>

<p>Thank you tons for the kind comment and the compliments.  &lt;3</p><p>I discourage you from reapplying, just as I have been discouraging everyone else here. Unless something substantial changes between now and your next application a few months from now, it's highly unlikely that you will get in. If you're taking a gap year anyway, then sure, why not. But I wouldn't put bigger, more important dreams on hold in hopes that MIT might maybe accept you, because chances are, MIT won't. And that would really suck.</p><p>I really, really hope that you find another university that can make you happy and give you a good education.

<p>Like the 7.7% admit rate and about maybe at least 30% of applicants being qualified. Like an entire dorm closing, very likely decreasing the number of students that could be admitted. Like schools selecting for culture fit in addition to being qualified, and culture fit being a very difficult thing for anyone to grasp. Like the necessarily subjective process of reading and assessing personal essays written by people with vastly different backgrounds in writing. Like luck, good or bad.</p>

<p>It is up to you, but I wouldn't.

If you're planning on taking a year off anyway, then why not.

<p>I think the majority of us here would be lying if we said that we weren’t disappointed. Like many applicants, I would dream about being an undergraduate student at MIT. Sure, that dream didn’t come true, but that’s the risk we take when we choose to aim high and dream big – it certainly doesn’t mean that we should stop dreaming! In fact, the best thing to do might be to dream some more!</p><p>Me? I’m going to dream about the honors program at the university I will be attending – I’m going to dream about researching, or inventing, or maybe even using my knowledge of electrical engineering on a trip to another country! And who knows? When it comes time for me to get a graduate education, maybe I’ll be considering MIT once again. The truth is, no one knows! But that’s a large part of what makes dreaming possible.</p><p>Whatever you do, wherever you go, don’t let the fear of failure stop you from dreaming big!

I'm just a student, but I'm pretty sure the admissions officers would say the same thing.</p><p>My understanding is that the people who read your application probably got very attached to you as a person, started imagining the good you could do at MIT and beyond, and were very invested in you getting in.

<p>One way in which MIT can reach many students is by distance<br>learning program.</p><p>You film each and every lectures of the class, projects of<br>students and we too will upload our projects and works and all sort of awesome<br>stuffs , and make it available to the people who were not admitted. We could<br>have the digital experience of learning at MIT from our home towns. This will<br>surely reduce the pain of those who were not admitted and also your pain of<br>rejecting students who were qualified were not admitted due to less seats.</p><p>Will you do this for your fellow earthlings. The whole world<br>will grow and develop faster than now if each country start helping and getting<br>help from other countries mostly in this way of providing good quality<br>education for the future generations.</p>

<p>My advice is don't, unless you were planning to take a year off anyway. If you didn't get in this year you're very unlikely to get in next year unless something substantial changes in your application over the next few months (or you get very, very lucky). I personally don't think it's a large enough chance for it to be worth putting your life on hold.</p>

Note that this is different from the number of students from each country who applied or the number that was accepted.

<p>I think that if you think it would make you happy to apply again then you can try, but you need to keep at the forefront of your mind the very likely possibility that you will be rejected. By applying again, will you be setting aside any other opportunities (like other schools you could be happy at) that you will regret giving up? Will you be putting your life on hold? If so then don't apply again. Keep in mind that unless you plan to apply as a transfer, you cannot enroll at another university and also apply again to MIT.</p>

One really big thing he and I did not agree on was what it means to be human and the possible implications of augmenting the human experience. I sent your comment along to him and we are both very amused.</p><p>Anyway, fantastic comment. Please don't hold your life up another year for MIT. You deserve to live your dreams; you don't deserve to have them put on hold just in case you maybe possibly might get a spot at MIT. You have way bigger things to give the world than getting into MIT, and I think you have too much to do for your dreams to wait. I am confident that you will do big things.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your help Lydia. I didn’t give any of the<br>tests (literally) like sat ,act,toefl.</p><p>I didn’t have a clue of MIT nor did anyone here before December<br>2013.</p><p>I checked out your institute and some other too (havard and Cambridge<br>but Cambridge application was closed already) and first started understanding<br>your system which is entirely different from our country. After each step I didn’t have a clue of what will come next<br>and then I found out about the test that I have to take and I applied too. Here<br>in my country we all dream of getting into IIT and we are a pool of 1800000<br>students. We first give the IIT JEE MAINS test and top 150000 ranks gets the<br>chance to give the IIT JEE ADVANCED and 2000 are admitted and the rest go to<br>other colleges like NIT s. My chances of getting into it is like 99 % and I am<br>damn sure to go into IIT. I came to north part of my country (I am from south<br>part) for IIT exam coaching and then learnt about MIT in December 2013. I didn’t<br>give the test because I didn’t have the passport for which I have to go to my<br>home town to apply and get it but I couldn’t go as my IIT coaching was going<br>on. That’s why I didn’t give any test and didn’t apply for any other university<br>other than MIT because the MIT blog said they do not admit students based on<br>only numbers. So I thought I had a chance if I get an interview with which I will<br>show them what i know in astrophysics,quantum physics, relativity, time travel, and my<br>hypothesis that i discovered . But my interview was waived.</p><p>So can I apply next year and I’ll give all the tests. And also<br>I definitely need an interview, if not possible in person then at least in a live video<br>conference (skype). How improved will my chances be? This year nothing was shown about<br>me in the application except the essays I wrote. Next year whole lot<br>information I can give the admission office. So what do you suggest Lydia.</p>

MIT Student
<p>Hey guys, I just want to chime in real quick. I got into MIT as both an undergrad and a grad student, and although I love this place, looking back on it I realize that I'd be just as fine had I gone to any other good (top 50ish) school. My brothers, for example, applied to MIT and did not get in. They, however, worked arguably just as hard as I did at different respectable universities, did incredibly well, and have both attained their dream occupations.</p><p>The fact is, it's a not a big deal at all. You focus so hard on rankings and statistics as per the culture ingrained in our American society when you really should not. You can and will get an equally good education elsewhere if a good education is what you're after. You can, and probably will, be just as--or perhaps even more--successful going elsewhere (or nowhere). MIT is a school. It is not an end, but a potential means to whatever it is that you want to do afterwards. The companies here all hire at many other places, and top graduate programs take students from hundreds of other places.</p><p>The point is, being rejected means very little to nothing in reality, and you shouldn't feel bad about it. You'll go off to another fine institution, do very well (likely better relative to others than you would at MIT), and achieve your dreams. I guarantee it.</p>

<p>It's killing, killing me to think that MIT rejected me twice. This time it hurts so hard because I know it was completely out of my control. It..is...just..that....MIT...and...I....are...not....a...good....match (I'm literally crying as I'm writing this). <br>I want to tell you all something that you need to take very seriously: 99% of the most amazing, smart, sarcastic, sensitive, special, talented and remarkable people I work with (and I'm not a high school student, I work in a big company) DID NOT go to MIT. I can also tell you that the last time an MIT graduate was interviewed at the company for the same position as mine, he didn't get it. Going to MIT is great! It's a special experience! But MIT does not implant in you some in-body chip that makes you a better engineer (I bet <a data-dsq-mention="mitadmissions-757b505cfd34c64c85ca5b5690ee5293:disqus" href="https://disqus.com/by/mitadmissions-757b505cfd34c64c85ca5b5690ee5293/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://disqus.com/by/mitadmissions-757b505cfd34c64c85ca5b5690ee5293/">Lydia K. '14, MEng '16</a>  would resist :P) or gives you an immunity from failure. And I didn't apply thinking that. I felt that MIT and I were a good match and that I needed to go through the MIT experience. It's going to be alright. I promise. DO NOT let MIT own the rules of being awesome. The admissions committee has no clairvoyants. They are people like you and me. They cannot foresee the future. They can't decide who will impact the most. They just decide who gets in. You might just be one of those people they missed out.</p>

<p>Honestly, I knew the chances were slim, but I honestly thought I had a shot. Now I am completely lost. I'm an international student who has dreamed of going to MIT since I was little. Now I don't know what I'm going to do. I applied to other universities too but already Caltech and MIT have rejected me. I wish I could speak to an admissions officer or an alumni to see what went wrong, how I can get better and, really, if there is still any chance. I don't know wether this is common in the US, but in my country, if you don't get into an university, you just try again next year. I don't know if this is possible at MIT or even if this first rejection would affect their decision about me next year... I also heard of transfering, but from what I've heard, the chances are slimmer than getting in as a freshman...</p><p>As I said, I am lost. If anyone could help me out, I would appreciate it.</p>

But oh well, if it doesn't happen, I'll just take a gap year and bake some more cookies.</p><p>It was a pleasure dreaming of being part of this community for a while, and I hope the class of 2018 is as exceptional as it is said to be.<br>And for all the other rejected students : huge virtual hug, our life is not stopping here (lets hope its not) &lt;3</p>

<p>&lt;3 Thank you and thank you for reading my blog posts.</p><p>Why do you think you won't get in anywhere? If you are extraordinary enough that you wanted to go to a place like MIT, I think it's likely that you have a lot of college acceptances in your near future.</p><p>MIT is not the only top university, and MIT is not the only place where amazing research happens. In fact, you would likely have more time for research, and get farther in research, at a place that doesn't have such demanding or time consuming coursework. It's very hard to get any research done at MIT except in the summers.</p><p>Rejection and reproach are constants in life, even (especially) at MIT. They'll be around no matter where you go. Don't let it get you down. You *can't* let it get you down. You are so much bigger than any rejection, and you have too much to do to let it get in the way.</p><p>Cookies and a movie sounds fantastic. I hope you feel happier soon. Don't be angry at yourself.

<p>Hi, I just wanted to thank everyone who commented here because it's been helpful in making me feel better. When I saw I was rejected I felt numb at first and then really sad and disappointed. As an international student from Argentina I knew it was a long shot, but I'm a dreamer, so I had to give it a try. As others have said, the only way to have had 0% chances would've been not to apply at all!</p><p> The way I see it, we shouldn't take any rejection too personally because, if you really think about it, it's not YOU who is being rejected, it's the small fragments of yourself that you were able to express through your application. It isn't a complete picture of yourself, you're MUCH more than a few words about yourself and some numbers on your testing record. The admissions officers don't really know YOU, so don't think you aren't good enough- deep down you and the people who truly know you know you are awesome (you probably wouldn't even have considered applying to MIT if not!). Just keep being your amazing self and find another way to accomplish your bigger dream, what you hoped to achieve beyond MIT, as Lydia pointed out.</p><p> Thank you to everyone at MIT who is taking the time to answer all of our comments, it means a lot. I love all the blogs! Best of luck to everyone, wherever you end up! &lt;3</p>

<p>I think the most disappointing part of the decision was that this was the application I worked hardest on. Not that I didn't work hard on the others; I had 7 other schools and I could probably be happy at any of them, and my applications reflect that. There is no question, however, that my MIT application was the best single representation of myself that I've ever had to create: all of my hard work, dreams, and quirks were written out, to the best of my ability, in those online text boxes. It's hard not to see this rejection as a rejection of me as a person, even if I know that's not what it is. Congratulations to everyone who made it. It's an accomplish that you shouldn't take lightly.</p>

WHY?
<p>CHRIS P., LATASHA  AND ALL ADMISSION PERSONAL- PLEASE<br>READ THIS.</p><p> m_quinn: <br>While I assume these comments will fall upon deaf ears, you have<br>prompted me to respond to you.  I am a parent of a student who was dreaming of coming to MIT, but has not been accepted.  We both came on these blogs over the last two years to get info., and after being on many college website, I can tell you they are unique and helpful. I couldn’t help but notice your bitter, negative comments that pop up on literally every thread. I feel so sorry for you. You have expanded a great deal of time and energy on your negativity.   I suppose you somehow believe your comments are constructive and will somehow<br>make a difference in the way MIT makes decisions.  I guess you think you are helpful to all the people who were rejected. I mean misery loves company, right? In a way you have been very helpful, in a way you didn’t intend.</p><p>I have been able to show my child a real-life example of someone who has let bitterness and self-hatred take over their life.  Someone who has wasted a great deal of time.  Someone I hope they never, ever<br>become.  Someone I pity.  I wish you’d take your time and energy and<br>use it more usefully, but it seems you are addicted to these forums.  I anticipate your negative comments on this post.</p><p>FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT ACCEPTED AT MIT:<br>As a result of setting a goal of MIT, my child worked harder and improved their grades and their class ranking to the point of being in the top 2% of their class and received SAT and ACT scores in the top 1%. Were it not for the hope of MIT, and the realistic understanding of the slim chance of acceptance, they may not already have 7 acceptances with very nice scholarships waiting at other institutions,<br>all ranked in the top engineering schools. As probably most of you have, too. They now have Honors College acceptances and invitations to apply for several full scholarships. What’s the down side?  Having the lofty goal of MIT has raised many of these students up. m-quinn<br>is seeking to have you join his pity-party and allow hatred and failure to fill your hearts.  Why? As my child, and probably many others, said in an essay, “WE all fail sometimes, that’s life. It’s our attitude that determines if we are a failure.”</p><p>PLEASE, please don’t become m_quinn. I hope you will all choose to go to another college and shine!  Bloom where you are planted.  One other student posted: many successful people went to MIT, but many more didn’t!</p>

<p>It's funny. Like, I've seen so many people from the blogs who were so aghast and heartbroken from rejection. But... Strangely,  I don't feel anything. Actually, I laughed from the fact that I had dreams for the last three weeks about my impending rejection. Makes me realize if this is all a coincidence.<br>But no matter. I knew from the start that my chances were slim, and that there are so many people who have done so much. To be angry about rejection is selfish and close-minded. <br>So I'm happy, that this college, like any other, have given their heart into reading mine, and 18000 others, in a span of a mere 2 months. I didn't eat breakfast or lunch but managed to eat a buffet of πs from my orgo preaentation. I watched a whole season of "Couples Fear Factor" (you should totally watch it btw).<br>And of course, I'll still be reading MIT blogs because it is fun to read the bloggers' stories.<br>Anyways, stay awesome.</p><p>P.S. to all who reads this, grad school is what counts in the end.

<p>It took me awhile to formulate this comment. So yes MIT is/was my dream school and its not that I can't go to MIT in particular that has got me down. It's the fact that I applied to 20 schools and none of them can even compare to MIT. They are all same brand, different flavor. MIT is endlessly unique and I perceive it as the best undergraduate school for me due to its culture. Right now, I simply feel lost,  the college admissions process doesn't even matter because all the schools I applied to are all the same. Sure its just 4 years of my life and I will accomplish so much but these are the often cited best 4 years of ones life. I'm not going to pretend I won't be happy wherever I go but I'll always think I'd be happier at MIT and I say this as someone who's been on campus several times and done several college visits so this is not my naivete speaking. I also understand I'm lucky enough to even have the ability to apply to college. It's all the blogs fault that I fell in love with this school 4 years ago, so keep doing what you're doing MIT and thank you for your consideration.</p>

Also, I'm already accepted to UT, which, while certainly not as prestigious, still has the best Computer Science program in Texas. After I get my Associate's there, I'll probably reapply to MIT, which, if I do get accepted, I'll be far more prepared to actually attend.

<p>This is a bit late to comment, but this is how it went with me.</p><p>I checked the result in the morning, saw my rejection and just sat quietly at my desk. I hadn't really expected to get in. Before logging in, I decided to write a short note to myself -  two lists. One of all the things I wished I had done but never could and will try, and one of all the things I'm so glad I did. I didn't want my thoughts to be influenced by things to come and tarnished by time.</p><p>I realised I'm glad I did the things I did because I cared about them, and not to "get into" any college. Then if rejection comes, you feel glad you at least found meaning in the things you did. I'm glad I got good grades through school and did national math olympiads because I was desperate to know and be the best I possibly could. And realising all this maybe makes the rejection hurt not so much. I haven't done something glamorous like travel to another country for a competition and never heard of Intel and first or "started a company". And it's okay, because at least the things I did know of, in my situation, and other things I managed to hunt out and find out about- I liked doing them. <br>It took some time for this forceful "It's okay" to finally allow the decision to sink in. I cried my eyes out for this half day, and I really just don't know what to "blame" for my foolish ignorance of all the things I could still have done. "Blame" sounds like a negative word but I just mean the cause and effect relationship. <br></p>

<p>Actually of all those offered admission each year, the percent who actually choose to attend MIT is around 67-72% of the pool.  MIT plans on that "yield".  Obviously many of those who choose to attend another school often have great options to trade between, such as Stanford, CalTech, Carnegie Mellon, Harvard, etc.  I have met many future students at events like CPW that were trying to decide.  And I suspect a few after being in the New England weather in April perhaps decide they are not 4 Season people and want the climate controlled south or california.  Best of luck with all your other options.</p>

<p>I was expecting this. But when I saw the rejection I still cried. <br>Writing an application is, somehow, just like writing a love letter. You pour all your heart in and wait for a response, even when the chances are slim.<br>One thing different is that it was during the application process, during the hours on this site that made me emotionally attached to this great institution. I dreamed about getting in, dreamed about talking to these kind people face to face, dreamed about everything.<br>As an international applicant I knew the possibility is abysmal, but when it came, it is still a heartbreak.<br>Really and truly.</p>

<p>Well, when you get rejection and reproach from all over the place constently, it's pretty hard to think that you're actually worth something, that you have any value whatsoever. But I guess if I don't get in anywhere I'll just engage in the red cross,maybe someone in the world needs me, and maybe it will give me the chance to help people,even though it won't be to the same level I wanted. Well, now I am going to keep crying for a while, and then I'll bake cookies and watch a movie in the hope it will lift myself up a bit. And then I'll find a new dream which does take the help of a top institution and of a top research institute to be realized. I am just so angry at myself for even thinking it was possible.</p><p>But thank you for your support, you are an amazing blogger, and I will greatly miss reading your stories.</p>

<p>Once you graduate high school and matriculate at another college you would need to apply as a transfer student. You cannot apply again as a freshman. You would get transfer credits if you got in, but it is likely that you would still need to take an extra semester or two at MIT.</p>

<p>Rejected. I already had an idea about my application drawbacks, No TOEFL, No SAT and Average academic performance in Science subjects, plus an International Applicant from an under-developed country. Also over-age :D. At this point I just cant complain, I had a great favor from many people around me. Motivations, Support, Discussions and Opportunities. All I can do is Regret. :-( I did many mistakes in my life.</p><p>The post clearly states that the Application pool was even bigger (or biggest) and MIT could admit exceptional people who posses rare abilities etc. That simply doesn't mean that you lack something, it means there exist many people in the world who are more brilliant than you LOL! and we have to accept this. Lets take this as a challenge and lets prove ourselves that we are no less than those 1600. We should be positive and chose alternate ways to achieve our goals.<br>Now those people, who are rejected and sad because of the decision, please don't lose hope and don't let this decision affect your actual dreams and passion.

<p>Now you should definitely reapply. You know what . You must have noticed that there is an extra essay that MIT admission committee demands to see at the end of the application . No essay can be a better on than this one.They actually expect someone to tell a great story that expresses the person more on a human level , may be call it how nice the person is , what is his/her emotional status.Is the person really a nice human being and all ( basically things that we can't find about a person on Exam score Sheet .) Trust me all you have to do is just copy and paste the link of this comment ( After deleting mine,otherwise they'll think I kind of worked like a broker ) .<br>         You have a wonderful story to tell Amrithaa.

You applied to MIT in order to do amazing things, and you will still do amazing things with the life you have been given, regardless of whether or not MIT is a part of it. You were an incredible person before you applied, you were an incredible person before you got your admissions decision, and you are still an incredible person now. MIT can't take that away, and neither can anyone else. What is the dream that got you to apply? That's what really matters, not this admissions decision.

<p>Now that I'm out of the disappointment, I just realize what a jerk I have been in this Comment Box. I should learn to control my disappointment, I guess. Any classes for that, anyone? :P <br>On a serious note, <br>THANK YOU MIT FOR THIS WONDERFUL ADMISSION PROCESS. It was the most fun-filled Admission Process I've ever been through. <br>MIT, in a true sense, is a great School. All the People at MIT Admissions were really helpful. People like Latasha Boyd replied without any agitation to the thousands of queries I emailed her. People like Chris Peterson, whom I truly believe to be the King of the Internet and everyone sitting there who took time to read all our applications.<br>Thank you very much.</p><p>Second, these amazing Bloggers. You all are amazing, in true sense. All your posts are full of life. They actually make every aspirant and reader dream about this wonderful place. <br>All of you played a major part in instilling this love towards MIT inside me. It was because of you that I actually applied to MIT, went through this wonderful Process of filling out the form, Writing all my essays from my heart, Reaching out to teachers at High School, Talking to my Principal about the process, asking her to help me, getting teachers to write Recommendation letter and what not. <br>I actually shed a couple of pounds in December roaming all around my school searching for everybody involved. :P</p><p>Right, I was disappointed when I saw the decisions which is natural. In the past few months, MIT had become a dream. And when you learn that your dream is shattered, you are not expected to stand up and dance around. <br>Feeling really upset is natural. But what is important is to realize that You can't get everything you want. <br>But you will always get what you really deserve. Not that the rejected students were under dogs. We all are Brilliant people, for if we were not, we would not have geared up the courage to apply to MIT. It's just that MIT was not a part of our life. We surely deserve something else, and with time, we will achieve it with pride.</p><p>And I know I talked about Staying away from this site forever, BUT SEE? THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE! I'm back here in a few hours. And I know I'll never be able to part with this amazing site here. All the blogs you people write are amazing . I love this site, truly.</p><p>And cheers to the people I got to know through this site, via comments. Congratulations to all those who got in, HAVE LOTS OF FUN. And for those who didn't like me, Have lots of fun anyway. If you were shattered, like me again, Try Channelizing all your disappointment into something more productive. Trust me, it works. Look at me now, I'VE BEGUN TO FEEL HAPPY, yeah?</p><p>P.S - To all those who actually bothered to read this comment and managed to read it till the End, HI MATE! HOW ARE YOU DOING?

<p>The point of applications is to select students. By skipping one, MIT might be losing an amazing student which is not in their interests. Not reading an application defeats the purpose and I'm sure admissions officers would agree.</p>

<p>I feel like everything I've put myself through over the past four years- the AP courses, the multiple consecutive weeks of four or fewer hours of sleep a night, everything- has been for absolutely nothing. I've wanted to go here for as long as i can remember, but now i see that all the people who ever told me i wasn't smart enough or good enough to get in were right. I know I can reapply for grad school or apply as a transfer, but that does absolutely nothing to make me feel better. Maybe the worst part is, after all the blood, sweat, and tears I've put in the last several years, I got rejected with a paragraph. You couldn't at least give me more than that? </p>

<p>Man looks like you didn't get the point. It's really not the Scores that they admit. The only criteria to get into MIT is that Are they madly in love with you. Do they desperately need to see you in their entering class. You'll find guys with 98% scores and 100% scores in SAT not being admitted but at the same time someone who ( I don;t know how to make them love you, because If I did , I would have been typing in the admitted section ) can have something that will bound them to take him in at any cost , you get in. Now find that something in you. MIT really looks for who is really a nice person at the end of the day and whose sense of humor is more boring (kidding) after you finally crash through that one barrier of Testing scores.<br>Think about it. Now doubt scores are vital points but once you pass through it , it's really some more finner details about a person.<br>the only way you get into MIT is " IF MIT DESERVES YOU ".<br>take care.</p>

<p>What are the interviews worth, exactly? I ask because apparently three-and-a-half hours of deep conversation that leaves the E.C. saying (and I'm not paraphrasing) "I wish there were more kids in the world like you." isn't enough to get in. I'm not trying to be spiteful in the slightest, just to share my story.</p><p>Maybe it's not my place to leave such a note, but hopefully some prospective freshman sees this note next year, and this note is the one thing that keeps them grounded. Not that "because I couldn't get in, no one should be able to," but because it's important to realize that while having dreams is important, dreams are not the easiest things to achieve, and sometimes, they don't even live up to one's expectations. Dreams aren't impossible to achieve - but it's easy to fail in their pursuit, especially when you've overestimated yourself.</p><p>I guess I'm saying: don't think for a second that you've been accepted until you get your letter. The harsh reality is that ~93% of the kids who apply to MIT, don't get in. And even those lucky enough to get on the wait list need to remember that no more than 10-15 people who've been accepted will choose to not attend -- if even that many (10-15 might even be far too generous, I don't know the stats off the top of my head, sorry). So for the 700+ kids who make it to the wait list, less than 3% are offered admission.</p><p>No big deal, getting denied. I'll try again as soon as I can - I just get to live at home for another two years (community college -&gt; hopefully transfer).</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Don't do that. There are way bigger things to live for than admission to MIT. As someone who goes here I can tell you with complete confidence that MIT is not worth these kinds of feelings. Not even a little bit. You are perfect, and there is so much that you can do with the gift of life that you have. You are worth a lot more than a college admissions decision.</p><p>At the very least there's, like, watching movies. Do you know what's better than death?

<p>All right, so it seems that I didn't get in. Though it's kind of disappointing, it's fine anyway.</p><p>I'm not saying that I don't care it at all, but I have expected that I may not necessarily fit into MIT, one of the awesomest colleges in the world. Of course, it's commonsensical to say that MIT just can't admit everybody who applies. (Not to mention that when it comes to internationals like me, chances are even slimmer.)</p><p>I have expected this. Besides — no I'm not being modest — I was sure that I'm not the cream of the crop. After all, I didn't get medals at those olympiad stuff, nor did I get any 800 on those tests.</p><p>Yet, at the very least I DARED to give it a try. I had the courage to apply to the college that I have been dreaming of, and I put my best effort into the application process. It may sound crazy and ridiculous for me, a mediocre (by MIT standard, I'd say) student to do that, but who says that it's impossible, dude? Just try, and try with the best yourself, who knows what will happen? Bottom line: if you do, you may have a chance of success, however slim it may be; if you don't, your chance of success is merely zero, nil, nought. Am I right?</p><p>Now that I've applied, and I won't have any regret whatsoever.</p><p>As I wrote in my Common App essay (I still believe that one is the best of mine, but unfortunately It doesn't fit into MIT's essay topics), "Life is more of a *process* than a *result* — well, this really should be commonsensical, but many of us have simply forgotten it at some point." Yes, indeed. And I feel glad and satisfied that I haven't forgotten that. Perhaps the RESULT doesn't seem that important now.</p><p>(All of a sudden, a line in one of my favorite songs just hit to my mind: "Even though I didn't succeed/At least I've dreamed the best dream ever." Hey, isn't it beautiful?)</p><p>Finally, thank you all for reading this, plus a big thank you to the admission officers who have been reading my (and all other applicants') applications.

<p>Your login was successful, but you do not seem to meet the criteria necessary to receive a decision. Please make sure that you meet all of the following conditions:<br>You have applied for freshman admission (not transfer or graduate).<br>Your intended entry year (as designated in your MyMIT account) is 2014.<br>You applied in Regular Action, or were deferred in Early Action (the system is unable to display decisions for those who applied in Early Action and received a "final" action in December - i.e. admitted or denied).<br>*What does this mean exactly?  We still received an email saying that everything was submitted but I'm not sure what this means?</p>

<p>Thanks for what you guys do. It's hard not to get pissed or disappointed as a rejected applicant (I know that from personal experience, only about two hours ago), but in reality we understand the process. We know, deep down (as much as we hate to admit it), that there are a lot of amazing people that will never make it in, and that's just the fact of it.<br>Keep up the good work, Chris, and keep fighting the good fight. Perhaps in a different world we would all get accepted.</p>

<p>I feel your pain, guys, but this isn't the end of the world. It is entirely possible to surround yourself with thoughtful and passionate people at other schools (and in the long run you may even get more sleep :)). It's important to remember that where you go is less important than what you do there, and I know all of us are still capable of doing amazing things someplace else. Best of luck to you all! Even though I won't be seeing you at MIT, I hope you can all say you are glad you applied. If you hadn't, you would have never known! I know I would have regretted it for quite a while. Thank you MIT admissions, because no matter the outcome, the journey was worth every minute!</p>

<p>I wasn't accepted. It hurts. But I know I put my best effort into my application. I thought my accomplishments would earn at least a spot on the wait list, but the competition is tough and my achievements couldn't keep me afloat.<br>Clearly I'm just not ready for MIT. This isn't going to decelerate me though. The high road in life is a tough one to ride, but I'm not going to let this rejection letter push me down. I'm going to work harder, pave my own path, and build my own success. I'm going to earn what I can with what I have. I'm going to accomplish even greater things than I've done already, and never lose sight of my successful future. MIT is my dream college, one where I can live up to my full potential, and one day I'll re-apply. I'll prove I'm ready by working harder than ever and demonstrating what I'm capable of. It's going to be difficult, but the high road was never easy. I won't let one failure stop me from trying. Mark my words: you haven't heard the last of me :)</p>

<p>It's too bad that MIT supports affirmative action. I strongly feel that it is a violation of civil rights and think it prevents deserving students from getting in.

<p>I'm sorry, but as an 18 year old you cannot just expect the next four years of your life to define you for all the years that come after. You're sad; hell, we all are, but to say "I had dreams, I had ambition, I had talent"  and then simply give up seems very contradictory.</p><p>I don't know you personally or your background, but to simply fall into the belief that you have "nothing left to build any hope from" is not right. There is always hope regardless of where you end up. Maybe you could be the driving force to turn that state campus around. Maybe you'll end up at another "top-tier school" and be able to do a whole slew of things there. Heck, you may show up at MIT for graduate studies in four years time.</p><p>The point is, there are very few things in life that are a 'perfect' fit. It's easy to convince yourself that there exists only one 'perfect' fit. In reality though, every university has aspects which you will enjoy and aspects which you won't (as is the case with many other things in life). It's probably true that you identified with MIT more than anywhere else, but if you go into something believing that you are destined to hate it, then there's very little you can do to convince yourself otherwise. I don't mean to be speaking down to you or telling you that there's no reason to feel upset, because there is. It's just that you should understand that this rejection does not equate to the end of your dreams.</p>

<p>Only reason why I wanted to go to MIT was to do physics. I fell in love with it. As an international student (from a poor/corrupted country) I was quite certain that this will be my only chance to do it. Getting rejected gave me an inspiration, so I took a leap of faith. I just set a Faculty of Theoretical Physics as my first choice on a university I will probably get into.

<p>It isn't bad that you got rejected. It would have been bad if you didn't apply at all. The whole process, the months of hard work and the moments of anxiety are priceless. Applying really helped me to overcome so many barriers in my life. It gave me confidence that I am worth something and getting rejected doesn't change that fact. I think, as an international applicant, that applying to MIT is much more valuable than being accepted, for example, by the most prestigious English university, because the fact that you applied to such a selective college means that you have at least a little bit of what it takes to be the best of the best and that you set your sights extremely high. Thank you all and good luck for 2019!</p>

<p>So I've received two rejections in the past two days - this one and Caltech.  It's hard to know how to feel, but I've been so busy these past few months, doing neat things, making my friends happy... and I know they wouldn't want me to be any different, even if that different me would have gotten admitted.  My goal now is to keep doing what I'm doing, make some good happen wherever the heck I end up going, and really just...  have a good time.  I don't have to be at MIT for that to happen, although I certainly would have liked to be ;D</p><p>Thanks to the entire admissions committee for the time and energy you all put into this... I can't imagine how hard it is.  I kinda wish I could just sit in and observe just one day out of a committee session.  It seems kinda vague how everything happens in there, but I really do believe that you guys get emotionally invested in it as much as the applicants do.  I've learned a lot from the past few months.  Thanks for that :)</p><p>Good luck to everyone out there, admitted and not.  This is gonna be one heck of a ride.</p>

<p>I had time to process my decision, now comes the writing~</p><p>I can't really be disappointed with something that I was expecting. But I am, you know. And it's cool. It's okay to be disappointed. But it's time to move beyond that, yeah? I've spent the past year masochistically daydreaming about going to MIT. Picking dorms, going to classes, all the new things I'd get to learn. I imagined getting to know the T, imagining walking along the Charles River. I know where all the starbucks and the drugstores are nearby. I know where the two Sephoras are, where Ulta is. I know how to get to the MSPCA, and a billion other things. I've went to strange parts of the MIT website, the parts where admitted students are directed to, the parts for the orgs, the frats, the almost everythings. And it was fun. It was exciting. I imagined getting an acceptance letter, imagined maybe screaming. But I guess it's time to stop. Time to move on. MIT sounds like a wonderful place, and I still want to go. But it's time to let go. When we've fallen, the only thing left to do is stand back up.</p><p>People have lots of metaphors for going to college, for going to MIT. I have mine.</p><p>I'm at a bus stop. There's a place I want to go to. I'm very determined to go to this place, or the general area of this place. Well, the thing is, there's this really cool bus that passes by there. It passes by this bus stop. Lots of people want to ride this bus, but it's... sort of hard to get on. And even when you can, even when you're qualified, sometimes it's just full. Nothing wrong with you. The bus is just full, and there's nothing you can do about it. So just wait for the next bus. I'm sure that's as cool as this one. All the buses are full? Take the train. Take a cab. Ask someone to pick you up. Rent a bike. Run. Walk. If worse comes to worse, crawl. I don't care what life throws at me, and I don't care how I get there. But I will go to place, no matter what it takes.</p><p>Goodbye, MIT, it's been fun, and thank you so much for everything that I've learned from you. I'm moving on.</p><p>Also, thank you admissions bloggers and admissions committee because you are some of the loveliest people in the world. &lt;3</p><p>(Two more colleges left, and MIT are way more lenient than these two, so... yeah right. Good luck, me. Maybe transfer applicant next next year? HAHAHAHAH.)</p>

<p>As much as I expected that this would happen, it's still a bit of a bummer :-(</p><p>In any case, congratulations to the Class of 2018, and thank you to the MIT bloggers for giving all of us (admits and non-admits) a brief glimpse into life at MIT. It's been a blast following <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmitadmissions.org%3AGaLyq0IQQCFSCYfF9ZOrUeYVzYI&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="mitadmissions.org">mitadmissions.org</a> for the past few months and seeing all of the cool stuff you get up to! I still hope that I might be able to be part of MIT some day, but these blogs have made be spend a lot of time thinking about what it is I want to do with my life and how I can go about doing it, regardless of whether I'm at MIT. Kudos.</p><p>Now I need to go for a run somewhere and drown my sorrows in perspiration. Toodles :-)</p>

<p>I was an EA deferral and I almost wish they'd just denied me in December. I really don't know how to describe the way I feel right now. Kind of like being kicked when I'm already down from a terrible week at school, I guess. I just want those extra three months of not knowing back so I could have moved past this on a school break instead of at probably the worst point of my year so far. </p>

<p>The last 3 months have been  a roller coaster ride of despair and hope. It's like watching the lottery draw: you know how slim the odds are, but you still have hope, you believe you can win.</p><p>Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, but at least in this case I believe I won an important lesson. A couple of hours ago, I read here a post I'll remember -  "Defeat is the first step in victory". <br>This is the first time for me when I had a door closed on me. I had failures (more often than not that's how I start), but I always had a chance to go back and recover. In this case I wont (due to personal reasons), so I believe it was an invaluable experience which would only strengthen my resolve.</p><p>For future applicants, my strongest suggestion, and where I believe I failed: BE YOURSELF. If only I had read the blogs for months before my application rather than after, I would've known.</p><p>So now I will leave to do "what I do for fun" and should have wrote about.<br>Good luck to those who got in.</p>

<p>Many people are successful outside of MIT and build their own paths to success. MIT is a great institution with great people, and just like MIT there are many other institutions that fit that description.</p><p>If you look at the average student body of people who get into graduate school at MIT or "top" places, more than half of them came from state schools, liberal arts schools and so on, not MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc.</p><p>Your life is not ruined because you did not go to MIT, assuming you are 18-20 then you still have many and many years to do what you intend to do.</p>

<p>The pain that you get from getting rejected by MIT is way worse than pain of getting rejected by a girl or something. Today all my dreams and hopes were shattered in matter of minutes, and I don't know what I'm going to do with my life anymore. I guess the only thing I can do is keep my head up, and try again for grad school. You guys haven't seen last of me just yet because when I apply for grad school, I won't give you a reason to reject me.</p>

<p>Hi folks... As a current MIT grad student, I just wanted to say that there are many chances in your life that might take you to MIT's hallowed halls. I didn't apply as an undergraduate nor would I have gotten in--you all are much more brilliant than I am, probably. If it's you're dream to be here, work hard and you'll be here! :)</p>

<p>Thank you guys, I believe that I grew as a person during the whole application process. It was worth a try, but as I wrote on my application, expect to hear about me in the future. Being at MIT has been my dream since I was 12, and I am not going to give up on it. Maybe now was not the time, but one day I'm going to walk the whole length of the infinite corridor as a student, maybe as a Transfer or a graduate student, but I'll be there. Wait for me ;)</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what will happen now. I had a slate of five top-tier schools that I knew that I would enjoy and love. Now before you go off and say "oh the right college will accept you" please respectfully shut up, as this statement missed the point. All the advice I have seen over the last several months mean absolutely nothing when faced with a rejection letter. I have analyzed these three places thoroughly (MIT was the last one) and determined that yes only at these places would I have a chance to thrive. I decided to visit my state safety and was appalled by how awful conditions were. People fighting to log in at midnight to get classes that go 500+ people, lack of resources, graduation in six years, and overall despondent feel of the campus. You would compete with a fellow classmate to get that better grade and put them down rather than collaborate.</p><p> I am now afraid and angry that for the next for years my being and intellectual soul will waste and rot away at subpar colleges. Now you may want to say "college is what you make of it" or "you just need the right college for you" I will tell you that yes indeed, MIT was by far the "right college for me." The aforementioned statements also means nothing when the college I wind up at has nothing to make things from. I had dreams, I had ambition, I had talent, I had drive for knowledge. I was one of the few at my large high school that could have stood a chance in the face of ivy leagues and top tier schools, and yet I get slapped in the face with a rejection that says "nope, you're not good enough because in committee, someone else beat you out." Transfer applications are even more hopeless than regular admissions and I fear that my life will come to nothing. Yes I know another piece of advice is "always hold onto your dreams" but that is very difficult when they are constantly crushed and forgotten in a horrid college environment.  Sure I want to be optimistic and I am trying, but the haunting knowledge of getting the short end of the stick forever just can't be beat.</p><p>The cliched and awful and horribly inaccurate statement of "you can still succeed by your own hard work" is a slap in the face to those who have blindly followed it for years, only to discover that outside circumstances do indeed screw you over. Finally, the statement of "build your own path to success" falls on my deaf ears when I realize that there is absolutely nothing left to build any hope from</p>

<p>well shucks... I really thought I had what it took... I suppose I can always apply for transfer next year or for grad school... I must still say thanks, because although I didn't get in, the goal of admission still pushed me throughout High School and made me better because of it. Seriously though, could y'all expand your class size? :D</p>

<p>Thank you MIT. Just know that the application process was amazing the small amount of time that I spent fantasizing about being on campus was a great one. I know it's just a place, of course it is. But nothing more can be said other than the fact I am glad I tried. To all of the other amazing people on here, other paths in life await us now. We can still be our amazing selves without MIT. Of course we can. So let's just take our decisions with a grain of salt and move on, for there are other incredibly amazing places that we've not even considered. :)</p>

<p>Hey everyone.</p><p>I just want to give you all a little advice when it comes to MIT/other <br>top universities, their decision and what comes after that.</p><p>Like many of you, 4 years ago I was an international student applying to<br> MIT, and like most of you did, (lets be realistic, acceptance rates <br>are abysmal) I got rejected. This rejection hit me pretty hard for a few<br> days, I always thought I was going to be part of MIT since I truly <br>loved the school and what it meant, but my dream was "broken". Do not <br>let a rejection break you down, take it and cope a few days, but do not <br>get depressed about it and make it feel you are not good enough for MIT <br>or any other top tier university.</p><p>Go to any other university you got into and excel at it. Make yourself <br>be known and get involved with research or a laboratory group early on <br>(as early as possible, do not wait a year). Being directly involved in <br>research will open many doors for you, many of which can later lead to <br>MIT or other amazing schools. My last few summers I have been graced <br>with the opportunity of performing research at MIT through a summer <br>research program aimed for students outside of MIT. Spending my summer <br>working at MIT and learning from other summer fellows has been one of <br>the best experiences of my life, however, I was not blinded by it. <br>During the summer I decided to talk to professors and researchers at MIT<br> and worked really hard on my research project. This combination of <br>networking and hard work culminated in being admitted to MIT's PhD <br>program in Biology as well as PhD programs at other great schools,</p><p>What I am trying to say is that do not get bummed if you do not make it <br>in the first time, go somewhere else and make yourself be known. Through<br> hard work and perseverance you can reach many places.</p><p>For those of you wondering, I am currently majoring in Biochemistry at a<br> state school, so if you have any questions regarding biological <br>research opportunities feel free to ask.</p><p>Also, for those interested in summer research programs/internships when <br>you are sophomores/juniors, here are the two from MIT that accept <br>international students. I was part of MSRP-Bio, so if you have any <br>questions feel free to ask.</p><p>Best of luck!</p><p>Wherever it is that you go, do not forget to give it your all and enjoy what you are doing.</p>

<p>Just a quick recap of what I tried to say in my last blog. I won't tell you not to feel low; I won't tell you that you should just shrug off the rejection and simply move on. It's not easy to move on. For the worth of emotions you all invested, this is one of the most difficult things to hear. But I've been down this path once, and I know that you should soak it in. For the moment, come to terms with the decision, and after that, move beyond it. See beyond it. Beyond the electronic letter and the little hope that will not achieve fruition at this moment. Things may feel bleak now, but there's the comfort of a future that's still promising, still waiting to be overtaken by your dreams and hopes, these things dear to you, things you've held long before your application, and things that will live on beyond today. You'll all be fine. It may not feel that way now, but you will be. And not just fine, but ultimately, happy. And much later, when you look back on today, it will be no more than a small bump on the road to what is ultimately your next great adventure.</p>
