<p>You know, the bloggers like to go on and on about how even if you don't get accepted, you're still the same person. And while you're still brilliant, and you still have your accomplishments, that's not true. Because a lot of us just lost a dream. A lot of us lost a dream we've had for years. And newsflash: that changes you. Having to regroup and trying to move on without that dream is hard. It's natural for it to change you. So while I appreciate the "you're still the same person" sentiment, I wish they wouldn't feed it to us, because it's bs, and invalidates the experiences of those of us that are rejected.</p>

<p>No, I am just applying regular action. Anyway, yesterday I kinda ruined my interview (not my fault tho :P). So maybe (? most likely? definitely?) I will be rejected. But I "[won't] let anything to stop [me] from doing great things!" &gt;:/ &gt;:D</p><p>BTW were you rejected or what?</p>

<p>(I deleted and reposted this after having some YouTube and clipboard struggles) (lol)</p><p>This time in December 2013 and also May 2014 (spring admissions season), morale was pretty low among my friend group. A lot of us had not gotten into dream schools, or had been deferred.</p><p>Now is the time for ice cream and music videos and venting to each other (my friends and I had a Ben &amp; Jerry's party after Spring admissions came out--we got every type in the grocery store!) (my favorite is S'mores) (Chocolate Therapy is particularly appropriate for the occasion, though). But, now, two years later, every one of those people is in a pretty good place. None of them were prevented from pursuing what they wanted to pursue. One person worked at a Colorado Senators office in Washington DC (relevant to her major in economics), another is committed to a biology research lab she even worked through during the summer, another switched her major from computer science to visual arts. The first year of college, people discovered a lot about themselves, grew, learned--regardless of where they went. And many of them felt, now on the "other side", that, in retrospect, college apps were not worth some of the stress some of us had over them; in the end, we all ended up still pursuing our goals, and finding our own ways to be happy.</p><p>Althought for right now it may feel like you're at the bottom, I'm sure you'll reach a top of your own. (but first, ice cream and music videos~)</p><p>Good luck!</p><p>(warning: explicit content) (but also the lyrics are motivational) (I think)<br><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRubBzkZzpUA%3AGqmVNIiM5BQqp6Ao6JQcBw0McI4&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubBzkZzpUA">https://www.youtube.com/wat...</a></p>

<p>This was originally in response to Connor (yes, that deleted comment was this one) but I think that this applies to everyone here.</p><p>It's easy to feel frustrated and I understand that. I wonder what will happen to me on Pi Day.<br>Anyway, why did you want to get into MIT?</p><p>If it was because you thought that MIT is a place where all the genius people go and because it sounded fancy then you didn't really see MIT for what it actually is, you didn't see it as a place with a soul, almost as if you could talk to it. You didnt see it as a diverse community of people who really do care, who enjoy life to its fullest. People here aren't "bookworms " which seems to contradict the popular opinion but it's true. <br>Maybe this isn't the place at which you would be the happiest or even the most successful. The admissions committee sees that and, although implicitly, tells you to search for the place you resonate with the most.<br>This isn't a criticism or even a statement on your worth, nor is your decision. You truly are  awesome, and you would most likely be more awesome someplace else.</p><p>Please don't take this the wrong way I'm only trying to help you get through with this because I realize how important it is to have someone's empathy at times like this.</p><p>Now, go watch Star Wars tomorrow. Feel better, you will! ‚ò∫</p>

<p>You just absolutely just broke my heart.  PLEASE don't think this way.  As an educator, I am anguished to think of a hard-working student second guessing every decision you've made.   To have accomplished all you have and been in the running at MIT makes you a winner.  You will thrive somewhere else because you have work ethic and intelligence.  Please be proud of yourself.  You deserve to be proud of yourself.</p>

<p>I am really dejected. As an international student coming from India it is very difficult to convince that our grading system is as rigorous &amp; much more competitive than the US system and unfortunately I didn't get an opportunity for interview as well. Should I reapply for RD?</p>

<p>Now that the decision has finally sunk in, I've been sobbing for the last two hours. Although I'm sure this is not the end, I believe that taking this frustration out is necessary in order to continue going, I believe today was a decisive day for all of us. Despite my current feelings, I think that this application was a great experience. I want to thank MIT for those awesome essay questions that made me understand myself a little better, I had my first interview because of this which was great too (at least I'll know better in future ones haha) and I had the opportunity to talk to extremely interesting people in order to find an available EC. Of course I was hoping for a better result but I'm sure there are great things out there for all of us, because just applying to a university like MIT requires a lot of courage and determination.</p><p>Happy holidays for all of you! üéÑ</p>

<p>It's hard to really take it in, but I guess it's for the better. No doubt there will be a lot of pondering over grades, achievements, essays, and the like. But in the end, the best thing is to move on. I'm sure that the effort put into applying for MIT will not go to waste, and I hope that everyone here will find somewhere where they can realize their full potential. I know it sucks to get rejected, but there's no use in working your way into a dead end.</p>

<p>I don't understand what I feel sometimes. I already expected 100% to not be admitted, and went in completely expecting denial (not even deferral). It's so much different seeing it for yourself. For the last two hours, I've been mentally out of it, wondering what I did wrong, why I did wrong, how I could have done better. How I could have changed the last few years of my life to make myself acceptable material for MIT. How I could have made myself more presentable. How every little step, every choice, choosing whether to study an extra 15 minutes for one course as opposed to another made the little differences, how each one built up and tumbled, collapsing with the hope I didn't know I had, the one I promised myself and my family that I wouldn't.</p><p>Looking back, in theory, if I was to be accepted, I would struggle. I would be in classes with those people who were prepped since birth for this education. Geniuses were admitted, geniuses ready to change the world, some who already have. Not everyone can change the world. I'm certainly not one of them.</p><p>Does academic rigor in the undergraduate level actually mean anything for your education? Certainly. Does it matter whether you receive that education from MIT, or another fine school? Possibly. Not everyone is suited for this type of curriculum, and we're the 2175 (and soon to be more) that didn't make the cut. To those who made it, I sincerely congratulate you on making it this far, and making your friends, family, and yourself proud. You should be proud. Go get a coffee, eat a pizza, make that "MIT 2020" Facebook post, do whatever makes you happy. You deserve it. To the rest of us, we're ready to go down another path (unless you're going to end it, which you shouldn't do so young). Make yourselves proud, because you should be for getting this far.</p><p>I'm sorry to those who aren't.</p>

<p>The applications process does not determine whether or not you're good enough, or worthy; it (from what I've read on here) determines whether you will be most successful at MIT.  You may have all of those attributes, but not be a good fit; and maybe you would do better somewhere else.</p>

<p>I don't get it. I raised my GPA to a 3.9 unweighted, just took the ACT again and I'm expecting at least a 34, I have 5 math and science credits (6 each depending on if you count economic math and computer science), I'm in 7 different groups averaging 40+ hours a month of total volunteer work, I own my own IT business, and much more. All of this was while I was homeschooling myself which makes all of this exponentially more difficult.  I don't understand where I could have improved to the point where I would be deemed worthy. <br></p>
