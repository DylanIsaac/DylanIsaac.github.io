<p>I know it&#8217;s difficult for you all. But Remember, Einstein wasn&#8217;t from MIT&#8230;..lol. Undoubtedly MIT is ONE of the best, but if you go and just sit there, you ain&#8217;t going to win any NOBEL prize. You need to work Harder and smartly, anywhere you are&#8230;.This poem is dedicated to you all. Improve yourself.<br />
If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br />
But make allowance for their doubting too,<br />
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />
Or being lied about, don&#8217;t deal in lies,<br />
Or being hated, don&#8217;t give way to hating,<br />
And yet don&#8217;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream&#8211;and not make dreams your master,<br />
If you can think&#8211;and not make thoughts your aim;<br />
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />
And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />
If you can bear to hear the truth you&#8217;ve spoken<br />
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />
And stoop and build &#8216;em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />
And never breath a word about your loss;<br />
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />
To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />
Except the Will which says to them: &#8220;Hold on!&#8221;</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
Or walk with kings&#8211;nor lose the common touch,<br />
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br />
If all men count with you, but none too much,<br />
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />
With sixty seconds&#8217; worth of distance run,<br />
Yours is the Earth and everything that&#8217;s in it,<br />
And&#8211;which is more&#8211;you&#8217;ll be a Man, my son!</p>

<p>Congratulations to everyone who got in!</p>
<p>In all honesty, I&#8217;m pretty relieved. This will made choosing my first-choice school so much easier!</p>
<p>I was kind of expecting this to happen, but I always had that little hope that I could have made it to deferred. For the most part, I wanted to apply to know that I could not get in rather than regret not applying when I&#8217;m older.</p>
<p>Anyway, all I really want to know now is what I could have done better. If I can improve myself at all, this is my chance to do so. Is there some way I can find out what what exactly was not up to standards?</p>
<p>If there is a way, great! If not, I&#8217;ll just try to improve everything.</p>

<p>So what does the deferred message and not admitted message look like?</p>
<p>I have:<br />
&#8220;The Admissions Committee has completed its review of your application and I am very sorry to tell you that we are unable to offer you admission to MIT.</p>
<p>This year we had more than 6,000 Early Action applications but fewer than 1,000 offers of admission. We expect to have a large Regular Action application pool as well, so this year is truly the most competitive ever at MIT. Please keep in mind that most of our applicants are exceptional students, including many who are not offered admission simply because we do not have enough space in our entering class.</p>
<p>I wish you the very best in all of your future endeavors.&#8221;</p>
<p>I assume that means rejected given the lack of the word &#8220;deferred&#8221;, although it&#8217;d be nice if they&#8217;d be more frank and have the word &#8220;rejected&#8221; in the message somewhere, just to make it clear. C&#8217;est le vie, I expected to be rejected, hoped I wouldn&#8217;t be&#8230; and well, now I am. What now? Time to send off my applications to Northeastern and USM now, I guess.</p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I know some of you are pretty disappointed about being rejected. I just want to point you to this blog post, which never fails to give me hope that the college admissions process might actually be all right:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/apply/the_selection_process_application_reading_committee_and_decisions/its_more_than_a_job.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/apply/the_selection_process_application_reading_committee_and_decisions/its_more_than_a_job.shtml</a></p>
<p>I know Ben&#8217;s not at MIT anymore, but his advice still applies and I&#8217;m sure that the rest of the MIT adcom shares his views as well. So please, keep your head up, knowing that you were not simply just forgotten and thrown aside, but that real people actually really cared about you.</p>
<p>Keep your head up and smile. You just got rejected by <i>the best college in the country</i> (or at least I think so, anyways). It&#8217;s not the end of the world. I know you&#8217;re all awesome, and I believe in you. <img src="https://mitadmissions.org/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></p>

All I can say is, Whoever got in, work hard, work very hard. Wherever I am, I&#8217;ll be working hard too; don&#8217;t drop your A-Game for a minute, because if you do, I&#8217;ll pass right by you, even if you are in the best school that exists.</p>

<p>you&#8217;re all intelligent people who know what you&#8217;re doing. Just make smart decisions and you&#8217;ll get places. Not going to MIT isn&#8217;t going to ruin your life. If it was your dream school, sorry. But why was it your dream school? The name? The environment? The people? Think for a second. And then make sure you try to replicate that environment at whatever college you matriculate to.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree with a lot of you. It would be great to find out what I was missing to get accepted or at least deferred. I think it may have been that my school isn&#8217;t as math and science focused as it should be, and I don&#8217;t have the opportunities to be in clubs related to math and science because it is a small school (about 150 students).</p>

<p>After thinking about it for a while, I think I&#8217;ve mourned enough over this. MIT made it&#8217;s decision, and I&#8217;m fine with it. I&#8217;ll still apply to MIT for graduate school and probably for a job. Ya know, I&#8217;ll always have a little spot for MIT in my heart, but sadly it&#8217;ll be next to the little MIT-shaped scar there too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve realized though, that there isn&#8217;t any need to worry. No matter what, there&#8217;s a bright future ahead for all of us. If you&#8217;re still sad or crying as I was, I&#8217;d like to give you the words of one of my most beloved teachers: &#8220;Whether it happens to you when you are sleeping or when you are awake, you will get through it. There is no need to worry.&#8221;</p>
