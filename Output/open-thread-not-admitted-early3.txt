<p>Thank you so much! People like you guys made it possible for us to get over it fast. My current plan is McGill / RPI for undergrad. Canada is a safe haven, especially for the next four years, haha.</p><p>I hope other applicants in this thread will accept the results as I did. Well, if I think about it, I could've done so much more in my high school years. But there's no time for regrets, because the only fatal failure is failing to adjust.</p>

<p>You are more than welcome to apply next year and if you want to take a gap year, then you should - No one ever regrets having taken a gap year, but plenty of people regret not having taken one.<br>If you enroll in another university then you can apply as a Transfer student next year but there is no way for us to predict your chance of admission - who knows where your life may lead you over the next year! <br>The one thing you shouldn't do is put your life on hold while you wait to re-apply - persevere and follow your dreams and continue to pursue things that engage and excite you! Best of luck on all your future endeavors :)</p>

<p>So, can we apply next year? Like if we take a gap year of attend somewhere else for a year? Or are we just as likely to not be admitted?</p>

<p>I'm really sorry. Best of luck in grad school apps, and in your other college applications in the meantime. :) I hope you have a fantastic college experience. I know you'll do amazing things, if you keep putting yourself out there and doing your best just as you have so far.</p><p>(If it makes you feel any better, the grad students here are, at least the ones I've met, for the most part not from MIT, or Harvard, or Stanford, etc. etc. etc. MIT is an excellent stepping stone to your dreams, and a beautiful one, but it is just that—a stepping stone, not the end of the journey.)</p>

<p>As an alum and someone who has volunteered at MIT for years, I will offer this perspective.  MIT does not have any bonus points or considerations for legacy, you have to earn that spot on merit.</p><p>However, that being said, a son or daughter of an MIT graduate is more than likely to have picked up a way of thinking and doing things from that parent that will often be something that is consistent with the MIT way, thus making you a potentially better fit.  Since MIT gets thousands more qualified applicants than they can accept each year, it comes down to things like fit.</p><p>I know a number of my fellow alums had kids apply and none of them got in.  Others had kids who had ZERO interest in going there, even if they might have been accepted.  (They did go to other highly competitive schools like the Ivys.)   Kids probably also have a better idea of what MIT means beyond the logo from just hearing their parent(s) talk about school.</p><p>Now this is not unique to MIT, but any school will probably find kids of alumni a slightly better fit on average due to how they were raised and what the kid was exposed to all those formative years.</p>

<p>And that is totally okay. We all deal in different ways (see mentions of ice cream elsewhere). But we want the message to shake this off as nothing that defines who you are or what you are capable of doing with your future.</p>

<p>It still feels so surreal to see that denial. My MIT journey ended just with a click.

<p>There's a scene in the first Harry Potter book where he can't stop looking for the Mirror of Erised. Dumbledore explains that the mirror holds many possibilities, but "it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live". Don't dwell on the 'if'. MIT was just one conduit or possibility in the mirror to reaching your dreams. Others will follow and can be a fit as long as you keep going.</p>
