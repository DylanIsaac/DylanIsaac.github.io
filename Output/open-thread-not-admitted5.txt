<p>While I am not surprised by the decision I must admit it still hurts. I began this journey last December when I reached out to try and play field hockey for the school. I tried my very best to not become too attached to MIT, but that is easier said than done. It is truly an amazing school, but what makes it special are the amazing people that fill it. I am honored to have been deferred, and wish to extend my congratulations to those that were accepted and hope that you will cherish the next four years. I am excited for my future, and I hope that everyone finds their own success in life. Thank you so much for these blogs, I have enjoyed laughing and relating to all of your lovely comments.</p>

<p>I'm not sure who will read this, but being an alum interviewer and in general having graduated from college 6 years ago and becoming an Old(er) Person has given me some (perhaps not much, but still some) perspective.</p><p>Yes, I got into MIT, but I realize more than ever that life now is so much more than "I must get into XXX University" or "I must achieve YYY score on this test" or "I must become ZZZ person." It's easy to be goal oriented in primary, secondary, college, and even postgraduate school because you're on a ladder where everyone is compared via the same standard -- the same grades, the same prestige, and the same end goal of trying to get to the next checkpoint where you can compare yourself to someone else all over again. It's good to be goal-oriented and self-driven, and it's natural to feel disappointed after a setback or not reaching your intended goal, but it doesn't have to be the benchmark of your success or your self-worth.</p><p>Once your peers transition out of school, you start to see how gifted different people are outside of academics, and honestly even 6 years out the fact that I graduated from MIT matters very little in my daily life. Sure, I have MIT to thank for 4 years of great memories (and even my wife!) but having not gone to The Best Medical School or The Best Residency Program I think (although at the times disappointing) didn't ultimately matter in terms of what I discovered about myself, where I am now, and where I'm headed to in the future in my medical career.</p><p>There's no such thing as a place where you can't learn something new, and there's no person who you can't learn something interesting from. It's our goal and our job to always challenge ourselves, whereever we are, to be a better version of the person we were yesterday. We owe ourselves that, and if you're feeling disappointed now, you owe it to yourself more than ever.</p><p>This is basically a long-winded way to say "life goes on," but I truly believe it. Cry, binge eat, do whatever you need for the next few days to process the decision, but on Monday, a new week begins and along with it, a set of new challenges. Tackle it head on, and you'll be on your way again.</p><p>The late neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi who wrote a moving book about his perspective on life after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer offered a great perspective on treating patients while dealing with the possibility and inevitability of death: "You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving." I believe this message applies equally to anyone who has ever had a dream deferred.</p><p>Now we soldier on.</p>

<p>I started the journey towards MIT around a year ago. It's been an amazing year. I was motivated to join and do so many amazing opportunities, all the while thinking, this is the spirit of MIT. I'm not sure if I feel disappointed with the decision, because basically I wanted to get into MIT to find like minded geniuses. I found many amazing people and skills in my life. Reading the various comments in this thread and how people accept the rejection to what was their dream college in a civil manner reaffirms that everything is going to be great. I have had moments today when my brain screams at me to recalibrate my plans, and I will. But I'm glad I decided to apply. </p>

<p>There are many others paths to success. MIT isn't the sole path, but rather a platform to cultivate a portion of the world's innovators and intellectuals. I'm sure that there'll be others who will be just as successful or even more successful without attending MIT or any of the other prestigious or prominent universities. Remember, it's your own character, values, and virtues that define your identity, and thus your dignity after numerous struggles and glories.</p><p>There will be opportunities out there, we just have to support each other and grab them altogether. On the other hand, there'll also always be rejections, failures, and hardships in life, maybe more or less distinctively, but should you ever want to give up, try thinking about your initial plans and how far you've traveled till now. Sometimes, we just need a little motivation from the surrounding and we'll walk far and ahead. Therefore, look down and reflect, look up and move on, for the ashes of yesterday will not triumph and desecrate the auspices of tomorrow, and we'll strive on united, into an ever more promising future. Nonetheless, have ample faith and God bless everyone regardless of diversity. No matter the circumstances, all the best to everyone! [From: Singapore =) ]</p>

I talked about how MIT students are inspiring and do incredible things, and simply how MIT is amazing.</p><p>When the countdown ended, I could hear my mom silently praying.</p><p>Later we both realized I was rejected....On the moment, I was not even sad. My mom and I had so much fun waiting for decisions, and my rejection letter was actually recomforting..</p><p>A few hours later, now that I come back from school and I cannot stop crying... Come on.. I can do this.</p><p>I think most of us know  that admissions decision do not determine us as a person.  But it is not about that... we just love this school... to the point it might be unhealthy *laugh* *sob*</p><p>I hope we all get over this obstacle and instead feel excited for the unknown blessings the future holds.

<p>Hey guys. Just like most of you, I spent the major part of senior year dreaming about MIT, and the dome was my desktop wallpaper for the whole year. Every blog I read intensified my belief that I belonged here, and I felt a longing that I've never felt before. And getting rejected was crushing. In one moment, all my hopes dashed, and the realization setting in that there is no point in me coming here anymore, for I can never be a part of this world.<br>I gave myself a couple of hours to wallow in self pity, and then I guess I just decided to move on. I read Tuesdays with Morrie once again, and remembered that there's a lot more to life than to just graduate from the best college. Watched The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, and reaffirmed my wish to see the world. Swam with my brother for a while, and thanked god for everything that I already had. We've all got a whole life left to life, and this is nothing but the beginning. So, just go and do things that inspire you, that form a part of who you are. Lets brush off the pain and pity and sorrow, and wake up to a new beautiful day. Au revoir MIT, and salut the world!!!</p>

<p>And I would like to say thank you as well. Thank you for making me try my best, push through all the limits of what I thought was possible for me to do. I've learnt whole a lot about what sort of opportunities are out there from the MIT community. Wherever I go, I'm going to try and find my way into those opportunities. If I have to stay in India, I'll be finding a way to do those things I'd be doing at MIT the hard way. At MIT, I'd be able to do NASA competitions as an undergraduate by just joining the Robotics club and asking the guys if I could help. In India, perhaps I'll have to contact my professors, ask them if they know enough brilliant students to support me and then make satellites for ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). That would also be new to a lot of people, letting them know what sort of opportunities are out there.At MIT, I'd able to get a UROP easily, maybe I'll have to struggle for that in India but maybe it is possible. I don't fear having to struggle, because I think at least in the region where I live (a rural area in India), I think that's what I do at the finest as compared to everyone else.</p><p>I think there were a lot of things that I couldn't mention in my application but anyways maybe I was good but not good enough - FOR THE TIME BEING. When I say that I mean I'm not good enough TODAY. I know what I've become in the last 2 years, as compared to what I was.</p><p>Well, maybe everything hasn't ended yet. I also applied to Harvard, Princeton and Yale but I doubt I'll get into them.</p><p>No matter which uni I go to, I'll still be able to make myself a great "person".</p><p>Thank you, not only to the admissions officers but to the whole MIT community.</p>

<p>I got rejected, but it's really within my expectation. They said it is incredibly difficult for international students to get in and like only less than four percent can get the acceptance letter, and I don't have some gold medal from IMO or IOI which a lot of international applicants have...</p><p>Some of my classmates joked about those who receive a no letter from colleges, because they paid like $70 to it and spent a lot of effort in writing college essay and it turned out to be nothing. But I do feel, even at this point, that I can say I never regret on the decision to apply to MIT. The time I spent in exploring the school told me that there are a lot of things humans can do. There ARE a lot of people who really did something great, and that is not in the movies or somewhere far far away. It's just there, at a specific place in Cambridge, MA and it just happened. It is possible, not a joke or aftereffects.</p><p>I always thought my dream to solve human intelligence and apply it to AI systems is too far, too empty, too impossible because it's like something that only happen in movies, which is fake, not true. But on and on, reading lots and lots and lots of articles and news and books in this area, I found, well, it might become true someday. It is no longer far because I can see there are already some people working on it and one day I may join them.</p><p>I remember a long time ago I read one blog on this site that says "you can change the world even if you don't get into MIT". Maybe that's true, because there are a lot of people who doesn't graduate from MIT and changed the world. The day that I, myself, change the world, may be far far away, but one day I will get there, and I will try my best.</p><p>Thanks for the admission committee who read my application carefully and viewed me as an individual person, not a number on the screen. I really, really appreciate that.</p>

<p>Are you sure there is no way to know if there was a specific reason why we did not get admitted? I know there is no "special match" or a list of criteria to fullfill to get admitted, but really, I wish I could at least know... WHY? Grades? Essays? "Just not enough space"... So maybe why give the space to the others and not to us? I'm not saying that being, like, angry or mad at you, but could you please let us know, for the sake of all the people who got rejected and wish they could you know why :-)</p><p></p>

<p>Hi I wish I could be fine with the decision I've received, but right now I'm not. I'm so so sad, and I can't make it stop. I'm thinking about all of the experiences I won't have, about how the next four years of my life will not play out as I'd hoped. I'm sad to think that I could have tried harder and done more but lacked whatever I needed to do so. I don't know how I'm going to get through this, but I hope I do soon. I thought I'd be angry, but I'm just deeply hurt. What makes this rejection harder is that I was deferred. I made myself physically sick in anticipation on many occasions over the last 4 months, and I went through a lot to try and get myself together and put my best foot forward. Whatever I did wasn't enough, and I feel like a waste of my own efforts as well as the support people gave me along the way, and I'm sorry. I wish there were some way I could repay everyone. I feel like such a disappointment, like everything that was put towards my ambitions was futile. </p>

<p>I thought I did everything right- great extracurriculars, number one in my class, an interview that went perfect, thoughtful and personal essays, experience relevant to my major (civil engineering)- except for my SAT scores. I knew that a 1430 was less than desired for MIT, but I thought "holistic admissions" actually existed and that the rest of my application would offset my low scores. But maybe this was a good thing- I think I'll be better off somewhere else, hopefully Cornell.</p>

<p>I tested the admissions committee. I wanted to know if it can see the potential in students, and whether it would admit students with a future rather than a past, so I intentionally left out a huge component of my application. I recently created patented a new clean energy technology. I have been receiving multi-million dollar offers for the patent, but I am keeping the patent private until Q2 of 2018. I chose not to mention this because I wanted to find out if the committee could see my potential through my personality expressed in my essays. Unfortunately, I have come to discover that admissions committees are focused on the previous accomplishments of applicants (SAT scores, GPAs, national awards), rather than seeing the future that lies ahead of applicants with driven personalities. I will attend the school that sees the potential in me. The MIT admissions committee has failed this test and I am very disappointed to say the least.</p>

I have devoted a hell lot of time for it's application before I came to know that I coudn't complete the testing requirements. <br>Having no option there, instead of simply throwing my well-furnished essays into the dustbin, I just applied.<br>The thought that At least I have applied, no matter what the circumstances are, has been bigger than anything else!</p><p>And Voila! There came a surprise! I was deferred instead of being rejected!<br>I had some hopes before I realised that they might have deferred me hoping for my scores to come up till regular action. But as I wrote, no matter how unfortunate, but I just coudn't write them this year!</p><p>I don't know, if through some filtration process, i was rejected in first round itself or not, but being deferred was the thing that literally sucks!<br>MIT should be little more careful about whom they are deferring...<br>It has been fine with me as I anticipated my result, but I can think of all those who waited for another 3 months just to be informed that they are rejected!</p><p>Anyway, Thank you MIT for letting such an incomplete application get in and to my surprise, defer it!!!</p><p>No  matter what happens, MIT IS LOVE!<br>I shall apply to it next year. Yeah, Yeah, with my SAT scores!</p><p>But I really wonder, was my application even read?</p>

<p>I felt fine earlier when I first saw my decision, but it seems to hurt more now than it did before. My parents were already trying to talk to me about other colleges/universities right after I told them and that really stung. I have seen a few of my dreams die this year but this was the one I was hoping would miraculously survive. <br>Nonetheless, I have matured somewhat through this process and do not hold the hyper-competitive nature of admissions at MIT against the Institute. I did the best I could. I'm sure the admissions officers did the best they could. I don't know what it was about my application that wasn't up to par, but frankly, it doesn't matter now. Being rejected here and other places has taught me that I'm the deciding factor in my future, not my dream school. I don't want to prove MIT wrong about me or anything like that; I simply strive to carve my own path, however painful or arduous it may be. Thank you for helping me learn more about myself and for inspiring me. It is partly because of you that I plan to spend this summer learning all I can about the arduino and projects that can be made with it, in addition to hopefully getting a civil engineering internship to see what it's like. You showed me the value of creating things and I so desperately wanted to indulge in that creation at the institute, but alas, I cannot. Thank you so much for everything (including this opportunity to talk about our feelings; it was therapeutic).</p>

Still my participation in MIT Launch 2016 will always be remembered and i hope my life path intersects MIT someday, if not, then HAKUNAMATATA.</p>

<p>My dream university... the place where I thought I had the highest chance of getting accepted. My financial situations are such that I don't have the money to attend a university in the US without financial support. It's likely that I'll be rejected from everywhere I applied to.<br>Getting denied doesn't only hurt but destroys my life dreams, there's nowhere else in my home country where I would be able to get so many opportunities and meet so many amazing people in one place. I just lost the chance to attend the place where I tried with blood, toil, tears and passion to get in. I cried several times during the application process. Maybe this tells me that either I'm not good enough or I haven't tried my best, I have yet to show off what my best is.</p><p>Thank you for spending time to review my application. One thing I can assure you is, no matter where I go, I promise you, one day you'll hear of my name, for me having done something good.</p><p>With Kind Regards<br>Aayush Arya</p>

<p>It's all good - I was waiting for this to happen after getting deferred EA. I remember visiting MIT, and the first thing I said when I saw Killian Court was "wow, this is going to sting like hell if I get rejected." After checking my decision, I'm not too sure about my original comment. Rather than a rejection, I'll interpret this as a deferral to grad school. I truly feel that I belong at MIT, and I'll make sure I end up here in a few years.<br>Thanks so much for this opportunity, MIT. I'll be there soon enough :)</p>

<p>I fell in love with the school. After visiting twice and spending a week in MIT, I was like "this is the place where I belong to." Now I face the reality. I carefully ask out MIT on a date with me. MIT says "wait for 3 months and I'll give you a reply." I wait patiently and then today, she finally gave me a reply. "Nope." <br>I guess I'll find another school that I'd fall in love I guess. But, I'll tell you, it's gonna be hard.</p>

<p>I guess this means this journey has come to an end... Not! This was just a pit stop. Applying to MIT was just the beginning. We still have so many miles to cover before this race is actually over.</p><p>I was rejected but I do not regret applying to MIT at all. My heart was definitely not ready to see those words of rejection; even my brain anticipated a "We think you and MIT are a great match". Maybe I am a great match with MIT but it's just not meant to be. Whatever the reason... I still think MIT is the coolest place there is and applying has changed me. It sent me driving at top gear headed for this pit stop... I didn't get what I wanted here, but the race is still on and I can still pull a few more laps before my next pit stop.</p><p>All the best, everyone. </p>

<p>Well, actually I really wanted to avoid taking a gap year, because preparing for it now would be a little late. And my parents don't want me to, either. It's just an idea I had because it seems like a possibility to get closer to MIT. Sure, transferring is an option - But I'd honestly feel bad to go somewhere else just to transfer out of it. And seeing how I was rejected now, I'll probably get rejected again. <br>I really have no idea what to do right now though... <br>Also, sorry for sounding so negative - I'm usually not that negative, but I can't help it right now =S</p>

<p>Ah, it's hard to be surprised by the inevitable. A few weeks ago, when explaining to friends that my MIT decision was impending, I noticed I had gotten a lot of " you don't seem like the MIT kind of person, though." It looks as if the MIT admissions committee agreed, but I can't say I'm anything less than at peace. High school saw me go from a B, C student in 8th grade to straight A's in the hardest classes for which I had passion, going from a mediocre tenth grade PSAT to perfect test scores across the board, JV soccer to Northeast United States Raider Champion. It saw me develop novel forms of high temperature superconductors at Carnegie Mellon, win awards for researching fluid dynamics, it saw me develop a computer program to integrate into a tutoring program I had initiated at my high school. It saw me endure my father's battle with cancer. It saw me develop my passion, and become the best self, and, according to my counselor, the best applicant I possibly could become: the whole while, college admissions was never a concern for me. And now, I look back, and it was worth every moment; I wouldn't trade any of it for admission to MIT. So, to MIT, thank you. Thank you for motivating so many young people to reach so high in the sciences and mathematics, and thank you for considering our match. I guess it wasn't meant to be, but I'm so glad I was privileged enough to be surrounded by the supporting, loving people throughout high school who helped me develop myself to the point that applying to MIT (and its ilk, for whose admission I still foolishly hope) turned out to be reasonable. I have only the best wishes for those admitted, and wish my peers good luck. I doubt I'll be applying to MIT in the future (maybe grad/buisiness school?), so for now, it's goodbye. Happy pi day!</p>

<p>Ouch.<br>It was expected, but...<br>Damn, that hurt. <br>Like a truck.<br>A truck on fire.<br>Aw man.<br>I had kind of a whole essay planned for this comment, but I'll just leave it at that.<br>I mean, I applied to other colleges as well, but the one college I really wanted to get in to was MIT... Over the past two years, I read literally all I could find on MIT, and, welp, kind of made it my dream to come here.</p><p>On another note, is it possible to take a gap year and apply again? This was kind of my biggest dream, and I'm kind of stubborn sometimes, so I don't feel like giving up just yet... If not I'll apply as a transfer.</p><p>Oh well.<br>Damn.<br>Nothing to be done, I guess.</p><p>(I'd planned to write something cheerful and not negative-sounding, but that somehow didn't work out, at all x.x)</p><p>God, I suck at this "feeling" stuff.</p><p>(Edit: Why is this "awaiting moderation" =o? Did I use some bad words?)</p>
