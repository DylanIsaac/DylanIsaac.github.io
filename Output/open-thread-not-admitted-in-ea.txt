<p>I think this was in the quote list MIT sent out to all the applicants: "It matters not where one goes to college, but what one grows to be" -Dumbledore...I may have paraphrased that but we all get the idea.</p>

<p>Thomas, you took this rejection like the gentleman and winner that you undoubtedly are. I salute your good humor and common sense, which will be of greater benefit to you than whatever name is on your diploma.</p>

<p>Although it would have been absolutely amazing to attent MIT, I have come to realize that it's grad school that really counts. Think about it, if you were to major in any kind of engineering here, the physics used would be the EXACT same physics used in another institution.</p><p>I'm challenging you all as the way I have set the challenge for myself: kick college's ass and get accepted to grad school. You are all geniuses in your own way, don't forget about that.</p><p>Albert Einstein once said (not exact quote) "Don't judge a fish by how well it can climb a tree. It will just go through life thinking it's stupid."<br>Do what you love:breath it, sleep it, dream it, do it to the ends of the earth, and you'll get what you want.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that I wanted to apply to MIT was because I heard of all the people that have gone to MIT and worked on their dreams, patenting new devices, starting companies, doing cool new research, and just pursuing their dreams. I wanted to be part of this environment and be one of those people.</p><p>Wikipedia has a list of notable people who have graduated from MIT, but I would be interested to see a list of people who applied and were rejected by MIT and went on to pursue their dreams somewhere else.</p><p>Of course I was disappointed when I was rejected, but now I am determined to prove MIT wrong in their decision. It's not about some sort of revenge or anything personal, but just a new challenge. For me, I would like to see if I can accomplish as much outside of MIT as if I had attended there.</p><p>Hopefully I can somehow be involved  later on with MIT whether as a transfer student or grad student, but until then I want to  I'll have a special place in my heart for this school.</p><p>Thank you very much for allowing me to dream and impacting my life without even accepting me.</p>

<p>This has been one amazing experience. I know it's hard not to think, "Wow, I'm not good enough." Many of us probably felt this way after the initial shock of reading the decision. I cried a little, then realized that there are so many other places to go, and MIT, though an excellent school, is not the only place to go. After experiencing denial, then the tremors of self-pity, anger, disappointment, and uselessness, I realized that, feeling sorry for my self wouldn't do anything. The other 5000 people who didn't get accepted also feel this way. I am thankful for MIT because it helped me realize that you can never aim too high. It is the best school in the North East, and in my eyes, the best school in the USA.</p><p>Through this experience, I have felt extremely nervous because of the admission process and the length of the wait. Though completely ridiculous, I would have rather heard the same day as the interview that I would not be admitted. We have all had a good run. Look at those awesome SAT I and SAT II scores! Those will get you into any other college you want!</p><p>For all of us, MIT was our #1, and for the majority of us it will remain that way. We have met some amazing alumni (shout out to Samantha Marquart!) and  all have had the pleasure of being a part of this. Don't feel down because we did not get accepted, but feel proud that we applied. Out of the approximate 314M people in the United States, about 6000 of the eligible college candidates applied for Early Action at MIT! Those are some amazing statistics. As probably 1 of 5 applicants in North Eastern Pennsylvania, I am proud that I applied because I can say that I was considered to go to MIT.</p><p>I was at least hoping for a  deferral too Marvin Y., but I will always remember this experience. In some ways I am glad that a decision was met, so I can finally stop thinking about this and move on. (my life has been on pause since I sent in my MIT application) I want to thank MIT for this excellent opportunity.</p><p>I congratulate all of you who were accepted, and I hope you have a wonderful time. I, personally, will be applying again as a transfer. Remember, stay positive and good luck in all future endeavors. (I apologize for the long post)</p>

<p>I was hoping for at least a deferral, but things happened the way they did. I want to thank MIT because in the process of applying, I learned a lot about myself. I learned how to dream and take steps to making my dreams a reality, even if I failed. Although I will be attending another college next year, there will always be a special place in my heart for MIT. I won't stop reading those amazing blogs! Again, thanks MIT for the experience and you'll be reading my application again in four years when I apply for grad school!</p>

<p>Rejected! Disappointing although somewhat affirming--in the final days before decisions were revealed, I realized that even if I had gotten accepted, I realistically would not be able to attend--stress and I are not good friends! Plus, you know, I had totally horrid SAT II scores.</p>

<p>I really wanted to go to MIT, and I am fairly upset that I didn't get in. I found myself wondering if there was a way I could apply again as part of regular decision to get another chance, but that's just wishful thinking. Perhaps I can transfer in next year! (also, does commenting here give me another chance to get in? :P )</p>

<p>Hello! Congratulations to all who were accepted!<br>But for the rest of us...as a deferred student, are we allowed to make changes to our current application forms and/or send in additional supplements?</p>
