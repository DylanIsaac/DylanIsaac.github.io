<p>Yeah, Didn&#8217;t make it. I sometimes wonder if there is something wrong with me. I didn&#8217;t get into Caltech, didn&#8217;t get into University of Chicago, now I didn&#8217;t get in here. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m a bad student, I&#8217;m getting a 4.0 in a college calculus class.</p>
<p>Well, enough sulking. I would like to thank the admissions staff for giving my application fair consideration and to others like me, best of luck in your future endeavors.</p>

<p>well&#8230;it&#8217;s almost a good thing to be rejected. It&#8217;s humbling in a way. While so many of the people who apply enjoy being in the top of their class they may sometimes be separated from the rest of the world of intellectuals. Now I am truely aware of just how many smart people out there. Without moments like these we&#8217;d all end up with inflated egos that would blow up in our face one day when we cannot handle a failure. I&#8217;m sorry we couldn&#8217;t be together MIT, but it&#8217;s been fun.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for the process&#8230; For me, I feel that I understand or perhaps agree (is that too optimistic)with the reasons why I was not admitted. The earlier notification was great though, the worst feeling was the ambivalence rather than rejection.

<p>I just wanted to say thank you to the entire admissions department for the all the time and energy you spent on selecting this year&#8217;s class. I hope that reading my application made you smile at least once, or made you think or reflect on some part of your own lives. While I am disappointed that I won&#8217;t be bumping into you on the Infinite next year, I am incredibly excited for all of the amazing people that you did admit.</p>
<p>I have to say that I did see this coming&#8230; most the financial aid forms I sent in a couple weeks ago were never processed. I sent in a big packet of stuff, and only the form that was on top was entered into the my.mit site. Oh well.</p>
<p>Anyways, thank you for this incredible journey, and a huge congratulations for all of those who were admitted.</p>
