<p>Sad that our son didn't get admitted, as MIT has been his dream school since he was 10.  But at least he will be closer to home, as we live in California and MIT was the only out of state university that he applied to.  I must say that I'm very impressed with the admissions process.  It's definitely been the best experience out of all the universities that our son has applied to.  Keep up the good work, and who knows, maybe our son will see you for his masters.  :)</p>

<p>Any rejection, I think, and any end to something, is going to feel like less than what the thing deserved. I remember my last day of TAing, after a long year of hard work, we ended our last meeting and said goodbye, and that was it, that was that. I suspect that many endings are going to feel that way. I hope you move on from this quickly and accomplish the dreams that motivated you to apply to MIT. You don't need a few sentences from admissions. Their opinion isn't important. What is important is that you get an education, and that you take full advantage of the opportunities you find and create for yourself. Best of luck.</p>

<p>I think one of the most important things I learned at MIT is that you don't have to be the best to do good, and that the important thing is doing good. This isn't to say that being or not being admitted to MIT is any sort of ranking, because it isn't, not at all. But I hope you move quickly to greater goals and accomplish the dreams that drove you to apply in the first place.</p>

<p>"No reason to feel invalidated by it." Yes! Exactly.</p><p>I think when I applied I thought that MIT was the end of the journey, the thing to accomplish. I didn't have very concrete goals in my technical career beyond getting into college. Which is fine! at that age. But it isn't the end of the journey, and it isn't the end of the hard work, wherever you are going to school. Some of my close friends have not been able to find jobs after graduating from MIT. Meanwhile, some of my friends from high school moved on from their safety schools to jobs that I might be applying to soon. I don't think there's a right answer here. Real life continues, and luckily (or not?) there is not one single hoop that you need to jump through in order to be happy or successful.</p><p>I do really, dearly, deeply hope that people who were not admitted to MIT (or who decide not to go to MIT or cannot go for whatever reason) find a place they can be happy--just as I hope that the people who do end up going here are happy here, and find that they love to call this place home.</p>

<p>And now the world crashes down at my feet. I thought I was great, smart, talented. Then 19,000 other people jumped into the pool with me and I was forced out, realizing that I have much to learn about the world. Things I thought I might be taught by the professors and other students at MIT, but for whatever reason(s) I'll be finding it elsewhere. Everything I've been striving for since I finished my application in November has led to this moment of utter disappointment.<br>     But life does, in fact, go on. I'm sure I'll be happy in Blacksburg, but I can't help but wonder what it would be like to be a part of the MIT community. But who knows? I might be on a different path than the one I originally thought I was on. Whether or not I end up staying at VT or transferring or getting my masters at MIT, I can't wait to see what the future has in store, and I hope many of you on this thread can share my optimism, even if it comes after a period of necessary sadness. :)</p>

<p>Try to view it as Not Admitted and not as a personal rejection.  There are only so many spots available and the committee has a painful task of trying to down select from a much larger pool of viable candidates.   There is just not enough room to offer admits to everyone.</p>

<p>Failed.<br>That's what I said when I opened the Decisions site this evening.<br>It was far too late last night , and I had an exam this morning(that was easy , though). This must be the first time where I actually felt that I was having 'butterflies' in my stomach that night!</p><p>But I'm only in 10th grade , and so yes , I have a couple of more years to try. I think though that I'll retry only in 12th.<br>By the way , was I rejected because of the fact that I'm only in 10th? I thought they have no such barrier...<br>Odd , but for some reason I can't stop thinking the relevance(even if it's minor or 0) to this question in my English exam today(see the photo). Don't know why.</p><p>I must admit though , I certainly did learn <i> a lot</i> , for instance when I had to buy a book to learn for SAT Physics because what you learn in 10th is far too little for SAT Physics(and even then I don't really know whether I did well or not).<br>Maths was better , since while there were stuff from 11th , I knew most of them already.(Maths is my favorite) Still , this was an amazing(and really testing) adventure , and even if I fell off in the end , what did I lose? I attempted , and lost.</p><p>This must be the <i>best</i> failure ever.</p><p>Anyway , congratulations to those who did not fall into this group , whether it's admitted or waitlisted(yes!). What I know is that you certainly did better than I did! I guess you must be having a party to celebrate , right? &lt;sigh&gt; Not for me. &lt;/sigh&gt;</p><p>Back to my books , with a pang of sadness in my heart. I have to revise for Maths on the 19th. Guess you don't.<br>Post-script:- Is there anyone with me?</p>

<p>Thanks for your measured approach to replies, Lydia! Some of the other bloggers have made comments that seem (in a subtle way) quite dismissive. In saying that someone will "find their happy place somewhere else," it subconsciously suggests that certain people only deserve to be janitors or to go to subpar universities (not saying those are equivalent). There are an incredible number of MIT graduates that do positively nothing interesting or novel, or just jump into finance and behave like parasites.</p><p>To contextualize why this is problematic, many (most) applicants have developed tunnel-vision about MIT.They fail to investigate universities (that they can actually aim for) that are in many ways superior to MIT. It's not that only the negative aspects of MIT should be emphasized; perhaps they should. It's rather that admissions bloggers like Chris do nothing but promote the MIT's positive characteristics. The jargony-ness of "IHTFP" often goes over some applicants' heads, especially those who've never visited Cambridge (hint: it's filthy). The censorship of extremely helpful physics talks on OCW because of (politics+dementia) was more than enough to embarrass MIT in the academic world, yet they still haven't put them back up.</p><p>Sure, it's a shame that people aren't accepted to x or don't qualify for y; but it's caused by an imperfect application review system, and a relatively monopolistic admissions market. No reason to feel invalidated by it.</p><p>-Reggie</p>

<p>Honestly, the hardest part wasn't the rejection, but rather the form of the rejection--an HTML template and a PNG of the signature of the Dean of Admissions. In my opinion (which a few of my friends also applying share) even one or two personalized sentences tailored to the merits and drawbacks of each individual applicant through the eyes of the Admissions Committee can help make the rejection letter more of a springboard than a brick wall, in future years.</p>

<p>I was a mental wreck during first semester senior year. I messed up on all my essaies, asked for rec letters from the wrong teachers, and basically just did what my parents told me to. I knew that this denial was coming, that gut instinct that comes after you click submit, because you know that everything you wrote is a load of crap. And yet it still hurts, being denied from the one school that you have been in love with since middle school. <br>Thank you for considering me as a potential student for the class of 2020. I've made too many mistakes this year, have been in much pain and distress, and have learned a lot from this gruesome ordeal. I probably won't apply as a transfer, and tbh I don't have the heart to attend MIT as a grad student. But I know a little bit more now, I'm a bit wiser, I've gotten stronger and can probably deal with any other terrible thing the world tries to throw at me.<br>I just wish I was this wise to begin with.

<p>Man...really hoped I wouldn't be posting to this thread, but a lot of things could be worse. Forum-goers, we're all in the same boat; maybe we've been blown off the intended course, but a change in direction is not a failed journey. Bloggers, thank you SO MUCH for every post that has made me smile on my darkest days, that has given me hope in the fog - goodbye to a community that I hoped to be a bigger part of, but have enjoyed peeking in on nonetheless. You are all worth it, every single one of you. Smile on!</p>

<p>I logged in to see the decision that I believe we all feared. Yet, it was an honor to apply. I would redo the entire process even knowing the outcome. As an international applicant, I was discouraged by the complexity of the process a little more than a year ago when I decided I wanted to apply to MIT. Yet, MIT gave me hope and helped me go through the entire process. Even though I will not study at MIT next fall, I was accepted in multiple amazing universities and will definitely have great undergraduate studies.</p><p>I come from a small town where I have been the first student to apply outside the country since the birth of the school. It was an honor. Keep being awesome, MIT rocks and will ever do. To all the admitted students, please enjoy your MIT studies as much as any of the rejected students who have done.</p><p>See ya in 4 years for grad school!</p>

<p>MIT is a place of education.  And it has taught me something incredible.  Getting deferred in December and now rejected taught me that I cannot put all of my hopes in one school as the magical way to achieve what I'm looking for - I have to earn this outcome.  MIT is a great school, yes, but at the end of the day, our education is what we make of it.  It has not been the easiest lesson to learn but it has been a valuable one nonetheless.  In the words of blogger Erick P., "Your life's legacy does not start nor end with MIT", and in the words of many, many, of my college-graduated mentors, "Everything happens for a reason."  I am in a really good place with this decision (although I might wish I had gotten a different one), and I hope that all of you can be, too.  Best of luck to our fellow applicants who were admitted or waitlisted and my sincere thanks to the admissions department for the obvious and sincere effort that they put into reviewing our applications.  Just as you were glad to know us, I was glad to know MIT, and I will carry its lessons with me as I go into the next four years.</p>

<p>It's hard to put words to what I'm feeling right now. This will be my first and last time posting in the MIT blogs after stalking them for almost a year. I let myself imagine studying there and being part of the amazing community for so long that I feel so empty inside now. I know this doesn't define my self-worth and I have other college choices that I know I will be happy at, but MIT was perfect for me for so many reasons. I keep reciting my essays in my head and wondering what I could have said differently that would have made a difference... the whole process seems like a coin flip. I guess I wish I could know what turned the coin one way or another. It's hard seeing a lot of your friends admitted who you know won't go and were just applying for "bragging rights" and wondering what you did "wrong". I really enjoyed writing the MIT essays and I hope someone in the admissions office chuckled a bit while reading them :) Thanks for the chance to apply!</p>

<p>Just forget about the fact that it didn't work out and soak up the reality that all of the hard work that you thought would pay off in the form of an MIT acceptance is meant for bigger accomplishments and will likely be even more beneficial to you in the long run.

<p>Thank you for the wonderful admissions experience. The application process made me grow as a human being by making me think about what I want to do in life. I have always had an interest in computers and technology. I volunteered to run an entire elementary school's IT department when the school district cut funding for tech specialists (the district tech people still don't like :P). Going through this process, I have learned that I do not just have a passion for computers, but for how PEOPLE interact with them as well. After I applied to your school, I learned what social computing was. It inspired me to see computers in an entirely different dimension. Although I did not get in, I feel stronger. For those of you who are disappointed about not being accepted, tomorrow is another day. The future is infinite! Whatever happens is meant to be!</p>

<p>So here we go. Every single thing we implemented during all our application process and other stuff that we had to go through has contributed in at least our self-development. Not sure that "I Will Survive" is the thing that we need to see now. It is not about surviving. It's about either stagnation or pursuing towards the great goals that most of us have. Thus, everything still depends on us and our way of perception of this refusal.</p><p>Dear MIT, miss me)</p><p>P. S. I'd recommend to use Fall Out Boy - Centuries.</p>

<p>I did see this coming, I knew it was a longshot. I know I'm not really a good writer, and I know that I didn't really show my main strength, my sense of purpose, in my essays very well. I know that it's no one's fault, that this is a bloody difficult job, and that I respect the admissions officers for doing it so well.</p><p>I also know that I will succeed wherever I go. All I really need are books, an engineering lab, and people to talk to and share ideas with, and I can get those things almost anywhere.</p><p>However, MIT definitely would have been the most fun place for me to spend the next four years. Through this blog, and Nina '19's blog (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthatmitgirl.tumblr.com%3AJb_mSSs5so29Qc6ib3kjqp5VC8o&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="thatmitgirl.tumblr.com">thatmitgirl.tumblr.com</a>), and through all of the public records of the day-to-day world of MIT students, I think I found my people. I get the impression that MIT has a very unique culture, one of "effortful fun", one of acceptance of all different interests and quirks.</p><p>So I guess that's what I'll be missing out on; and that does kind of feel frustrating. It feels unfair that so few places have a culture like this, that so few people get to experience it in their lifetimes.</p><p>I guess I'll just have to create that kind of culture myself. Time to learn how to create culture.</p><p>Here's to all of you who got in!</p>

<p>I applied last year, and I wasn't accepted. I didn't think I failed.</p><p>For starters, I was just a pretty regular high school student from pretty regular school in pretty regular town in Indonesia, with pretty regular achievements (no national / international science olympiad medal, sorry). Tracking from any point in MIT's history of accepting student from Indonesia, MIT always accept only one student (or two, if lucky) from Indonesia, and those who get accepted are ALWAYS international science olympiad medalist. My chance of acceptance was close to zero.</p><p>Well, I didn't know that. So I applied.</p><p>I studied twice (or three times?) as hard as my peers, because I had to study my own national curriculum AND the curriculum used in the standardized tests--all on my own because <br>- there was absolutely no test prep programs available nearby<br>- my school doesn't use international curriculum<br>In short, nobody in town was familiar with the materials for ACT, SAT, SAT II, AP, etc. Fortunately there was internet :)</p><p>I did all the paperworks (tax documents, grade reports, etc) all by myself, as nobody in town was familiar with the application system. I wrote my own recommendation letters because very few teachers were able to speak english. I woke up at 3 a.m. everyday, crafting my essays and studying for the tests.</p><p>I've mentioned before that I wasn't accepted.</p><p>But... all those effort wasn't useless. All these hours I devoted for studying was paid off in the local university entrance exam. I was accepted in the best medical school in the country (based on any international ranking). The selectivity rate was less than 1%, and given that students could only apply to 3 places (in Indonesia, student apply directly to a major in a university), the applicant pool was very selective.</p><p>As a very regular student from very regular origin, it was another impossible task. I'm probably the first student ever from my hometown to get into Faculty of Medicine University of Indonesia through the exam.</p><p>Logical explanation : I previously applied to MIT, so I studied in MIT standard. When you're a good archer, even if you miss the target, you won't stray much. My main target was MIT and I missed, but I wasn't disappointed with my result. Not only because my current school is very selective, but also because it is great (great study environment, great school life, great faculty, great friends, etc.)</p><p>By applying to MIT and fought for it to MIT standard, you have raised your personal quality. You'll get into other good places. Congrats!</p>

<p>It's easy to feel that way. I feel that way too, right now.

<p>I was hoping to get in to study physics. Maybe now I can study the gravitational effects of the massive hole this rejection left in my heart. Oh well, perhaps MIT-Senpai will notice me next year, after I apply again with more life under my belt. Best wishes to fellow rejects; we'll make do somehow.</p>

<p>This whole time has kind of been a journey away from MIT, to be honest. I'm glad it's over, and I'm glad I can move on from high school aspirations. I hope we all find new things to push us in whatever direction we want to go. It was a fun time talking to everyone. Thanks. (And thanks to the admissions officers for reading my application. It's a scarily big job.)</p>

<p>Bye bye blogs, it's been good knowing you for the past four years but it's best to not maintain contact. Like a nice clean breakup so that you can quickly move on. Bye Lydia, Anna, Mollie, Joel and everyone else. Thank you for sharing your wonderful lives with me but I guess it's about time I grow up. Perhaps grad school tho.<br>P.S. Lydia I actually dreamt of meeting you for coffee last night. Anna and Joel do everything I always wished for, and Mollie &amp; Adam were a fairytale.</p>

<p>Oh well. I look forward to crossing paths with some of the applicants and people at MIT I know in the future (be it in grad school at MIT or elsewhere, or in a completely different venue and context). Thank you to the Admissions staff for taking the time to review my application and deliver a response (although not the one hoped for).</p><p>I do have one annoyance, which is the choice of music linked in the blog post.</p>
