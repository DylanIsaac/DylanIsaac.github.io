<p>I commend you for having the courage to chase your dream, and you are absolutely right that it's important to take your mentality to wherever else you go.

<p>Just like many people have stated, I was prepared to not be admitted. Though being prepared still didn't null the disappointment I felt. I felt like I had let down everyone that supported me. I'm not one to fret, but missing out on an opportunity you can only achieve once in life is something that I don't think I will ever let go of. Everyone on here that has the courage to look at a dream that didn't come true, know that it is important to take your MIT mentality to wherever else you go. I hope the accepted individuals make use of everything this great school has to offer.</p>

<p>It doesnt help either that many say that the only real reason to get denied in early admission is zero chance of making it in the RD. It really stinks to be in the denied minority here. I know this may not be the case, but its hard to ignore. It eliminates the idea that i even had a chance at all.</p>

<p>Honestly, that hurt much more than i thought it would. After my interview, i really believed that MIT was the perfect place for me. Every comment i made my interviewer said matched MIT. It was already my dream to attend, not due to the prestigious academics, but that it matched every single thing i looked for in a school. At this point im just crushed. I know i can do great things at other colleges, and this mean im a bad student by any means. But all i worked for kinda got shot down with the word denied. Anyway, congratulations to those accepted or deferred, sorry for my rant!</p>

<p>I'm so sorry. I hope you can find a way to move on quickly, and to keep chasing the deeper dreams that inspired you to apply to MIT in the first place. I also focused on college admissions as my one major goal for most of my childhood. I'm really glad I had it to motivate me, and to push me to be the person I want to be. The hard work you put in still has value, and the person you have grown into is not something than an acceptance or a rejection can define. Keep pushing yourself!</p>

<p>Obviously, I’m disappointed. I am definitely sad that I was unable to gain admittance to my dream school, but beyond that, I’m scared. If with the application that I sent in (which I thought was fairly good and which I was very proud of) I wasn’t even deferred, I am afraid for my college future. Of course, I’ll never definitively know why I got rejected, but since my scores line up with the averages and the percentiles of MIT and because my values and goals also align very well, I’m just scared that my story and what it brings just isn’t enough for college admittance anywhere. I’m afraid that my resume and life experience, while unique, is just nothing desirable in any way to an institution of higher education. I don’t want to sound arrogant in at all (I knew that my chance of admittance was very very very slim), but the fact that I was just flat out rejected is so disheartening and has brought up many doubts about my college application profile as a whole. I’m probably overreacting, but I just can’t shake this feeling of insecurity about everything to do with college. Is anyone else feeling this way? Does anyone have tips on how to move on?</p>

<p>I have a lot of plans and ambitions in my life and MIT was one of them. I prepped myself for denial, put my feel good playlist on, and checked the page. I think my mom was more surprised/disappointed than I was. Fresh off my rejection from Caltech I had expected as much from MIT. For me, more than anything, this is just a reminder that my plans for myself don't always line up with what the world has in store. I have many more ambitions beyond college anyhow, so I am going to keep doing my thing and living my life. I'm going to keep diving into my passions and I hope you do the same.</p>

<p>Hi. <br>So right now I am crying myself to sleep because I opened the admissions decision - a rejection! I feel broken. MIT had my heart in its grip and they just let it go, shattering it into a gazillion pieces. I spent a considerable amount of time on my essays - a month and a half to be exact. I watched the open courseware, and even used them for some of my projects lol - I guess that's why they are there. I read countless blogs on how to write essays and of people who made it into MIT after making sure their essays reflected who they are. I really tried. I would fantasise about going to MIT and having a balance between theory and application (that's the meaning of their Latin motto "mens et menus"). It was heaven. I would have truly made it in life.</p><p>But I got rejected.  Straight up rejected. Not even deferred. Rejected.</p><p>Still, MIT will always be in my heart.</p><p>The application seriously digs into your personality, your goals and your social life. It is focused on knowing you, from your essays. I honestly think the only reason I got rejected were my essays. I had a couple of numbers: SAT 2: 800 math and physics GPA: 4.25. I even got the highest mark in the world for GCSE math, amongst other similar certificates. The numbers didn't matter, and I knew that.</p><p>My initial reaction to the rejection was that everything was for nothing. One and a half months of writing for nothing. My hopes, my dreams, my aspirations. Gone. Poof.</p><p>But the essays gave an opportunity to reflect. I now know the direction that I am striving to fulfill. That's all because of MIT's essay questions. Thank you, and hakuna matata.</p><p>Ending on a positive note: a friend of mine got accepted (we were in the same room - awkward, especially when I started crying). If you ever read this, I am extremely happy for you and I'm sorry I ruined your moment. I love you bro, best of luck at the university you choose to go to. Also, I noticed you really like your red and black boxers.</p>

<p>To everyone facing the sting of rejection, <br>Life is not over yet! Use the experience to rise stronger. Evaluate yourself. Grow. Become a better version of you. Almost of us are still only at the beginning of our lives. The first steps of our journey into the wide world. <br>Last year, I was not only ultimately rejected by MIT (more specifically forgotten on the waitlist) but rejected by every other american university that I applied to. I know how you feel. It initially broke me. But, I pieced myself back together and today I was relieved to receive my very first college acceptance after an unplanned gap year. <br>Rejection is never the end. Sometimes, it can even be a beginning. You all still have amazing journeys ahead.<br>-A foolish dreamer signing off</p>

<p>Very true. Regardless of where you go, your future is in your hands. You will flourish and do great things if you are motivated, responsible, and set that goal for yourself.

<p>You can't let this one decision dictate your future. My town was probably similar to yours in the sense that there was not more than two kids a year in the whole county who went to elite universities. However, while the decision is obviously not what is wanted, there will be another place out there that you will fit in and love. It seems that you have done a lot in your time in high school, and even before, so I have no doubt you will end up somewhere great where most importantly, you will flourish. I wish you luck in the future!!</p>

<p>I do not know the personal situation, but I had my fair share of rejections last year to be honest. I applied a lot of places, and I didn't get into a few of them. Theres a million reasons one could think of as to why one wouldn't have gotten in. Conversely, theres a million reasons one can think of as to why one should have gotten in. However, at the end of the day, one will never know. It is better to focus on the future and to keep being an incredible student who will end up doing incredible things for this world. I got rejected from a school I wanted to attend since the fifth grade, and I can assure you... that it definitely was for the best because opportunity has risen on a road I was not considering as much. :) I hope this helps and good luck in the future.</p>

<p>It certainly hurts, but we should all be proud that we submitted an application.

Remember, if you had the will to apply to MIT, you are bound to go on and do great things, no matter where you end up.  Everything happens for a reason, and I am sure all of us have or will have acceptances to other amazing colleges we may not have fully considered before this rejection!  For me, this is only a cue to keep on working harder.<br>Thanks.</p>

<p>The 2,498 students who were rejected and the 6,210 who were deferred and even the 185 withdrawals shouldn't feel at all sad, petrified, or with some feeling that something was "wrong" with them or their applications.  The vast majority of people who end up not going to MIT aren't looking back with any regret.  Think of it as fate steering them in the right direction, whether you want to believe it or not.  The majority of these people are also doing different things and participating in rigorous academics, maintaining high character, and end up being a strong match - elsewhere!  Sleep an 8 full hours tonight and start strategically thinking about elsewhere.  You could very well end up at MIT later on, as a graduate student, research assistant, staff member, or even a professor.</p>

<p>Half an hour to feel down seems about reasonable to me, so here's what I have to say. Odds are, MIT was your ceiling in terms of academics, luck and general alignment of circumstances so far. It certainly was for me. And I'd never jumped high enough to reach it before applying. Well, hitting my head hurt, but now I'm better, stronger, smarter, and my confidence is surprisingly higher as well. We put the best of us in the applications and dared to come all the way to here. And it feels times better to get rejected than to regret not trying. And when we'll be standing right where we want to be now, MIT or Mars or wherever, we'll take a moment and remember this letter as one of the greatest news in our lives, as a call to push ourselves further, develop and never stop.<br>So feel bad for a moment or two longer if you need to, but after that feel incredibly proud.
