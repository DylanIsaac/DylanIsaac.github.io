<p>In a sense, it's kinda painful to be in that 20% who got turned down of the EA's. In as sense, it's nice to know now and really give some thought as to anywhere else I haven't applied that I really should. In a sense it really bites to get turned down after doing a lot of great things- but after reading a lot of the responses in this thread, I feel better. <br>So thanks MIT, I've gone from shocked to disbelieving to angry to understanding to acceptance- and I kinda like the later two feelings now I'm over the first ones. Thanks for all you do- time, effort, enthusiasm... and you know what- there's always a chance for grad school ;)</p><p>I'm going to ask Chris for another funny .gif and one question, do you listen to any math rock?</p>

<p>So, because you now have the tenacity to stalk the MIT pages, you are shaming them for rejecting you in the first place? That's like the story line of the Incredibles dude (I had a better movie example on the tip of my tongue, but it's gone, unfortunately); you wanted to be part of something bigger-- thinking you would help-- you got turned away, and the seed of discord (that was there all along, mind you) just grew to the forefront. Perhaps your admission.pdf showed this seed. But your post rejection self certainly does.</p><p>My apologies for that being a bad example, but the point remains.</p>


<p>I assume it's because you are miffed about being rejected, but your "mightier than thou" attitude that you are putting out right now seems kinda like why you might have been rejected. I'm sure it's great that you can do genius things; but so can others. Take this opportunity as a challenge. You won't get the instant recognition of having graduated from MIT (unless you transfer in, of course), so you can make darn well sure to do something great while in the college you do go to. Set your goal on curing cancer, or inventing a time machine that can actually go backwards in time. At that point you wouldn't have to be upset about anything. You did something great, despite not going to the "known to be great" place. It makes you look extremely good. I had a deep seated feeling of despair upon seeing my rejected report (even more upset when I figured out that my retest of the SAT wouldn't shine on my application, so all I had was a measly 1740 (that's another issue all together)), but I accepted it. I was ultimately relying on luck, I'd say (even when people tell me I do something cool, I still don't feel proud of myself. Because there is always more you can do). I'd figure that a person like you managed to take a spot from me-- and that I want to meet the competitors in the sub-interval they chose from.</p><p>Meh, all I can say is, if it makes you feel better, think that someone out there who took your spot has just a good of a resume as yours.</p><p>If you then think about the kids who "have done nothing more than play in their high school bands," then think about the stored potential for them; as they may not have managed to open up their largely intellectual voice. (Also, band can be quite intense, and really doesn't leave time for much else; so your statement just established a fact, I'm sorry to say.)<br>And if you're anything like me, then just come to terms with the fact that your luck may often be found rummaging around somewhere in the core of the Earth, because it's just that darn low. Life is a divine comedy, and you should treat it as such. Say "this sucks" and then use that energy and hatred towards bad aspects of the life you have led, to make sure others don't have to experience them</p><p>I really hope this helps. And I'm sorry you have to go through with the rejection, but just know, that MIT often turns away 2400 SAT scores, (because what's a high score if not just indication of a ton of prep-time?) so, you may also take solace in the fact that there have also been people just as good as you who were also rejected.</p><p>-Joshua</p>

<p>My theory is the "random" factor of college admissions. They are looking for a group of people that will work together and they can't have a class of all starlets like you, what kind of community would that be after all? MIT just gets such a ridiculous amount of incredible applicants that I'm sure they have to resort to some random choosing to get a balanced class. I had some friends that didn't get into Stanford, and I know a much less "complete" and "talented" applicant who got in even though my friends had more impressive applications. That simply might be what happened to you :( I didn't get in either, and I started my own startup company developing some pretty successful iOS and Android games, one of which has over 50 thousand downloads. I'm sure my scores, grades, and essays weren't as good as yours so I'd also like to know what went wrong for my own personal sake (other college applications). But you gotta realize one thing you're awesome and you will be successful because your determination will always be with you regardless where you get in. Don't worry be happy my friend:)</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dd-diB65scQU%3AJnhI38-BMXLMHRfH8g8BBOz36Zs&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU">http://www.youtube.com/watc...</a></p>

<p>Wisdom from a procrastinating, overtired freshman:</p><p>A year ago, I eagerly awaited my REA decision from Stanford, which was my top choice. I waited, and waited, and waited. I could hardly stand the suspense when the email containing my admissions decision popped into my inbox. Without considering the magnitude of what I was about to see, I opened the email as quickly as I could.</p><p>Rejected.</p><p>I was crushed. "If Stanford rejected me," I thought, "how could I possibly get in anywhere else?" I sort of had a point. I wound up being rejected by Harvard and Harvey Mudd, among my other top choices. The thing is, I got into plenty of other places (for me, MIT included). College admissions--no matter how talented you may be--are a total crapshoot. Does ability play a role? Of course. But if you're "good enough" to bother applying to MIT, you're "good enough" to go just about anywhere.</p><p>I encourage you to take being rejected not as a setback but a reminder of the difficulty and randomness of the admissions process. Use your decision as motivation to polish your other applications a little more. Not going to MIT isn't the end of the world (just like how not going to Stanford wasn't for me); I promise you'll be satisfied with wherever you end up.</p>

<p>Could someone tell me what I was missing in my application?  You say you admit "the whole person".  Well, I am that "whole person" and more!  I have seen kids at MIT who have done nothing more than play in their high school band.  Is this fair to me, to see these kids there?  Sure, they have the personality and they might deserve it.  But I gave it all--and by all I mean 200%--and I don't even get one reason.  I loved the kids at MIT.  I would thrive there, as I did at Stanford and all the other intense environments that I've been placed in.  Please, read my application next time around. Once you've read it, then I will accept a rejection.  But before someone in the admissions committee reads it, I can't accept that I was rejected from a school that I could have made it in to.  Your promise to the applicants is that you take the admissions process "holistically".  You don't have me convinced.</p>

<p>MIT:  You did not read my application.  <br>You can admit the 2400's, the 4.0's, the president of a high school Speech and Debate Club.  But can you admit me, who worked on the largest National Science Foundation project ever, who attended Stanford University last summer, who works on an electrostatic accelerator and is building muon detectors, who is a ski instructor, and who received some of the most convincing LOR's from mentors who went to MIT, the CEO of my high school, and two AP teachers who both have field experience?  Can you admit me, who can not only engineer a product and analyze the stars, but passionately speak to people about it?  Me, with the most unique resume; I gave everything, risking myself even as a sophomore, telling people that I was worth my salt.  And every time I proved that I was, and I loved this.  <br>So what went wrong?  My interviewer told me point-blank:  "You have one hell of a shot".  <br>Yet I was rejected. Not even deferred.

<p>You're welcome and thanks.  :)</p><p>I think the best advice is to try to get straight As and go far in research in your field. Get good recommendation letters. You are likely to find big people in your field at your school. Hunt down those professors and try to work for them, and then amaze them with how good you are at research and life in general. If you can, try to get a publication, preferably first author. That puts you in a whole other category for graduate admissions.</p>
