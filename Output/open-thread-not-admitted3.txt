<p>When you feel lost, when you feel that all that pain you've gone through was just in vain, in pursuit of a dream, which seems it will remain a dream, to feel that you've risen from the abyss of darkness to fall back into it, when it seems that there is no way out, remember, the show is not over yet. However strong may the waves of despair be, do not abandon ship. Everyone in this world is born to fulfill their purpose in life. Think of it as a movie, if you leave the cinema during the sad part, you'll end up believing that life is sad, so I urge you to sit back and see it through the end, do what you were born to do, no matter how hard it seems, cause I have faith in you, and I have faith in your dreams and above all I believe that you will succeed.</p>

<p>For those of you who were not admitted, please do not be discouraged.  You are all fantastic, brilliant young people who have bright futures ahead of you! Thirty-three years ago, my husband was not admitted to MIT, his dream school. He was very disappointed at the time. He went on to graduate from Cornell in six years with a BS in EE, MEng in EE and an MBA. After Cornell, he went to medical school. There are a lot of wonderful universities out there.  Now we have two children who are both at MIT, which is more satisfying to him to have our children there than him having the opportunity to attend MIT himself. Be proud of yourself and your accomplishments and keep up the good work! </p>

<p>I wonder if competitive admissions offices are any better than fund investors. Because when it comes to the stock market, the market essentially outperforms all active traders. I know that admissions officers do their best to "build their mountain climbing team," but I still wonder if it would be better to have an element of chance in the admissions processes.</p><p>If I'm a competitive candidate, why not just classify me as such and throw my name in the bucket. At least that way there's no chance of having admissions officers prejudiced towards different applications based on how well they identify with their own experience. At least I'll know that I had a solid something-percent chance, and that my rejection letter was not just based on caprice or intuition.</p><p>Of course, there'd have to be adjustments made for whatever pseudo-quota system MIT uses, but we could still extend the lottery concept to more specific groupings.</p><p>Ugh, I don't want to be frustrated with admissions, but can't help but wish that the process was less of a black box; however, as long as MIT remains the king of tech, confirmation bias will probably continue to rue the day.</p><p>Food for thought: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Fstory%2Falmost-no-one-can-beat-the-market-2013-10-25%3A8XQtdPTKH66sBwOLeI0nQe1NzJg&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/almost-no-one-can-beat-the-market-2013-10-25">http://www.marketwatch.com/...</a></p>

My advice is to focus on the bigger dreams that got you to apply here in the first place, and to try and not let these negative emotions keep you away from working toward those goals. You don't need MIT to make them a reality, and they are much, much more important than where you learn for four-ish years. You will do amazing things in your life that will have a much more positive impact than getting into college. Best of luck on your future adventures. &lt;3</p>

<p>I think the toughest thing about having a son, who was well deserving to be accepted, having done all the right things and having had a passion for MIT of his own since the age of six, is seeing posts on college confidential of those accepted who don't think they will accept, and express that their hearts aren't in it in regards to MIT. So, there are those picked who really could care less about attending, and then there are those who would have, in their future careers, brought pride to MIT and who would have been such an asset to their chosen program, who will not be allowed to attend. That's probably the extra 'punch to the gutt.' <br>For all those, like my son, who wanted so very much to attend MIT, please do not let the rejection carry any weight on who you are, or what you are capable of doing. We all have a path, and someday you will look back and you will see that your path was meant to be even better. You can achieve anything, and even being rejected from your dream school will not stop you. </p>

<p>Hey guys. I'm already studying in a Business School in Karachi, Pakistan. I dreamt of coming to MIT after I had started college. So I gave the SAT (had to travel to a different city for that) and then the SAT II in December. And I applied. a few hours ago, I found out I was rejected.<br>Well, there are already plenty of inspirational posts here, and trust me I'm not just writing this to make everyone feel better. I'm writing this because its true: MIT was a dream, but it was never the GOAL. It wasn't the end in itself, but a means toward the goal. So me and MIT weren't meant to be together. Does that mean I can't achieve great things? NO.<br>I believe I can achieve great things, and I will. I believe I can cure my country of intolerance, and I will. I believe I can end terrorism in Pakistan, and I will. I believe I can show the world that my religion, Islam, is a religion of Love and peace; that The Holy Quran is the most beautiful Book ever written, because it wasn't written by any man, but by God Himself, and that it is the economic system brought by Muhammad, Peace be upon him, that is the solution for humanity.<br>And I want all of you to believe that you can achieve great things as well, even if it won't be through MIT.</p>

<p>Thank you all. You know what I will go in another college probably a French one (French college sucks) but it will be ok. My point is that we are intelligent, we are the future of the world, and some rules changes every generations. And today what we see is disruption. Young start-up beating huge industrial group on their grounds (I live in French-Guiana were rocket are launched (Ariane 5, Vega, Soyuz) and French people said 5 years ago that space x was a joke. Today they are really under pressure and I see them being more humble (Humility is a key in STEM).<br>Yes elon Musk attend Stanford and UPenn yes mark zuckerberg was at Harvard (like bill gate) . But they are all droped out. And the guy who making tumblr was rejected from MIT. So I dont care about prestige or good experience in college.I want knowledge (ans today it's everywhere). I know that my middle school was realy shit (one of the poorest in french-guiana) actually I'm in the best High school of my country (were rocket scientist's children go to school) Nothing can be more bad than the middle school of Macouria But it's where I fall in love for Linux STEM in general and the hacker's way. I becomming me at Macouria, I win prizes and fame at Kourou (the city where the rocket are launched) but Macouria still my home even is middle school was the ghetto. Im proud to say that I start from the bottom, from Macouria and when I look back I see the long way I crossed. Yes I'm really hard with me like all of you guy but I want to say that you can all beeing proud of what you did. Even if any one exept you can understand. Tomorow I will be back at school and saying to my conselor that I'm not admit. Many people will laugth and will say that Im crazy and that I did too much sacrifices for nothing. But in my heart I'll be true with me. Since I was 10 in Macouria I was dreaming of MIT, and MIT inspire me to learn by my self many things. MIT inspire me to start a compagny in 2013 and winning an international prize in FRANCE. MIT inspire me to allways looking for solution.<br>I applied to MIT. I was rejected.<br>I will not telling you the full journey I was obliged to follow to be here. It's about thousand kilometer's to pass test, hundred of hours to prepare it on my own time without any kind of help from my school. Is about dreaming when all people saying that you will not achieve it.<br>Yes the end of the trip is beeing rejected, but I did the road.<br>Be proud, And don't be ashamed to cry (I'm a tall French-guianese/ethiopian boy who is always stoic, and strong so crying is not an habitude but it was good to let the pression go).</p>

<p>Like many of the people here,  I dreamed of MIT.</p><p>I dreamed of living at Random, or East Campus, or pledging pika, and of wandering the corridors in the middle of the night, of burying myself in work and loving every minute of it, of exploring bioinformatics and neuroscience and physics and engineering,  of baking cookies with my floor mates, of learning to kayak on the Charles, of finding my own balance, of taking completely unrelated classes during IAP, of switching majors ten times, of waking up and seeing a new hack on the dome, of possibly being part of a hack myself one day. Yeah, I dreamed of MIT. I dreamed of becoming part of the place and leaving a small part of me there.</p><p>I think it's obvious that I didn't get in. I'm not quite sure what to do now. I'm not mourning the rejection itself so much as I'm mourning the loss of that dream. And I know it doesn't have to be MIT. Even though I'm not okay right now,  I will be. I'll fall in love with someplace else.</p><p>In case anyone who was admitted is reading this, I do wish you good luck. You deserve to be there. If we ever meet, whether in Silicon Valley or in Antarctica, or maybe even at MIT sometime in the far future, tell me about it. I miss it already. </p>

<p>Hello, everybody. I am an applicant from Mongolia who was rejected.</p><p>I want to thank MIT for inspiring me to dream big and work hard for the last couple of years. It was always surreal to dream about myself walking through the closest place to Hogwarts on Earth. I will continue walking through the Infinite Halls in my imagination. MIT will always have a special place in my heart.<br>I am sure that MIT admission officers do their best to admit the best applicants from a very competitive international pool. I am happy that MIT accepts one Mongolian applicants per admission cycle, which inspired me to dream of attending MIT. <br>Based on my research, MIT always accepted Mongolians who only participated in international olympiads. However, I have to note that -  I do not want to talk about my country - only some high schools, such as Sant School, have the privilege of sending their students to international olympiads, which becomes a big hook for their MIT application. <br>I am not writing this message because I felt bitter about my rejection: I am writing this message so that MIT admission officers will understand the fact that students of only certain schools in Mongolia represent Mongolia in international olympiads. I hope that MIT admission officers will factor this fact in their future endeavors, and I genuinely hope that Mongolian applicants who did not have chances to get the "international olympiad" hook will be treated equally.</p><p>I will continue loving and being a big fan of MIT. I hope that my message will be helpful for you guys - MIT admission officers.</p><p>Who knows? I might end up at MIT as a transfer or a graduate student. I hope that irrational dream of walking through the Infinite Halls will become rational one day. #amorfati</p><p>Thank you, MIT.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>M</p>

It could help in transfer admissions, and if you don't get in as a transfer you'll already have built yourself a good life where you are. Best of luck. &lt;3</p>

<p>In India, during the last quarter of ones senior year in high school, one registers for competitive exams to get admission into top Indian colleges. Exams like Joint Entrance Examination, Indian Statistical Institute Admission test, etc. are considered one of the toughest on this planet, passing them will land you up in a top college. However, if you are unfortunate enough to fall ill during your school final and you are unable to recover fully until the next year, then you stand ineligible to reappear for these examinations. I personally wrote a letter to the director of IIT Delhi stating my condition asking him whether IIT will let me reappear for its entrance exam. His answer came in a single word, 'No' . So you see even Albert Einstein or Paul Adrian Maurice Dirac will not be admitted to an Indian university if they fall ill and miss the once a year once a lifetime entrance test. </p>

<p>It's not at all offensive don't worry. Admission officers too empathize with you along with everyone here so unless you might begin to swear openly, no one might feel offended, especially today. <br>And don't feel so sad. Personally, I too am just like you, I want to be with people who are passionate about learning like those at MIT, I hate our education system which is grades based, our college admissions which are rank based, our student community that are future-job based and our rat-chase ideology. Plus, I too applied to MIT previous year, took a drop and reapplied this time, although I haven't seen the decision yet but you can be certain its most likely a rejection. What you are feeling is totally natural. Let the frustration leak out first. <br>Then think, how can you be certain that MIT is the right place for you in the first place. You can trust the officers on this one at least as they are doing this for years. They have read your application both times, considered it in it's best and then keeping in mind the limited available seats, the rest of the application pool, they took the decision. So it wasn't insincere to turn you down both times. As it's mostly said here, 'We recieve more deserving applicants than we can actually admit'. Ultimately, some have to be turned down. So buckle up, make a new plan, kick some butts!<br>All the best!</p>

<p>No, I don't know. If it helps, most of the grad students I know here went to less prestigious universities, where they could excel in their classes while still focusing on research. My understanding is that if you want to go to MIT for grad school, at least in my fields, you cannot have Cs and you must have publications.</p>

<p>*clicking a spoon on my wine glass*<br>Ladies and gentlemen! May I have your attention please.<br>To all my fellow prospective applicants for the Class of 2019 (irrelevant of your admission decision), it's been a pleasure being in the pool with you. It's cruelly  unfortunate that it's time for us to stand here for one. last. time and get - willingly or unwillingly - distinguished as either those who succeeded and those who didn't. But let not this mere conclusion of acceptance or rejection be an excuse for us to not gather at this last opportunity. And gather not as successful ones and failed ones, but as the ones who tried, with their might. So gentlemen, let me raise a toast. To the 'Prospectives of 2019', CHEERS!! *applause*</p><p>*out of that party-speech vibes*<br>It's finally come to an end! The waiting, those daydreams, the unbearable anxiety, the close football matches of 'thoughts' in your mind between 'accept or reject', those 'memories of MIT' which didn't happen in the first place but they seemed so, its cruel I know. I have been on the rejected side once and am most probably going to be on the rejected side again. It hurts definitely. But am not going to try to empathize or console here as I see most don't even need it in the first place. (Claps for that. Its very mature and brave to face broken dreams with smiles). This comment is about the Prospectives of 2019. Let's talk about the significance of your decision to apply to MIT. Something that might not had happened if you didn't have a MyMIT account, or something else you would like to share about your journey as a prospective for MIT.</p><p>(As for my admission decision if you are wondering, I haven't seen it yet and won't see it before 1st April).</p>

<p>Rejected for 2 years in a row! I don't know whether I'm frustrated or sad or 'pity is me'.......but I'm really confused now! I dropped out of college here because I don't like how the education system works here in India. The only thing people care about are test scores and degrees and nobody wants to learn for the fun and awesomeness of it! It's just a big long rat chase here and I applied to MIT last year hoping I could be be with people who loved learning and enjoy being quirky as much as I do. Well....I got rejected last year! But still...I kept doing what I love.....took a lot of online courses in different subjects that excites me......and even got as far TFing for a Harvard course called CS50....all of this through internet learning. I know I'm not good at writing and my scores don't reflect of how much I like learning things but I'm just really confused now! I also know that the decisions can't be changed but I just feel like telling all of this! It's really not a good feeling when you get rejected 2 years straight! I hope I get back to things and be awesome again! :)</p><p>PS. I apologize if any of the admissions committee people reading this find it as offensive. I don't mean to sound that way but things are just going strange! :/</p>

<p>It's hard to accept that I got rejected really because MIT was my dream school. In terms of the saying "If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room," MIT felt like the right room for me. Everything I've heard about the campus is exactly what I have looked for in every part of my life. Collaborating with some of the brightest minds of our generation would be a dream come true for me and it saddens me that I won't be a part of it at MIT.</p><p>The comforting fact is that I have received an offer of admission and a scholarship from my state's top public school, so no matter what I will be able to receive an excellent education. I just really wish I could be receiving it at MIT.</p><p>I'd like to thank all of the admissions officers for taking the time to review my application and wish all of those who were accepted the best of luck next year!</p>

Many of my other applications were denied this year, and it is for this reason that I simply do not have space for your denial as well. Therefore, I am very sorry to tell you that your denial has itself been denied, and I will be enrolling shortly.</p><p>I wish you the very best in all of your future hacks.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>A new MIT undergraduate</p><p>Obviously, I'm just joking. Thanks a lot to all of the MIT admissions officers whop spent the time to review my application. Congratulations to all of those who were admitted to MIT!! And to those of us who were not admitted, remember that ultimately it's up to us move forward and make the very best of ourselves, with or without MIT. Just keep your head up and, if need be, go get some ice cream to make yourselves feel better. We may not have been accepted, but we all have certainly found the best in each of us in applying to MIT.

<p>And bro, financially even I am feeling miserable because my father always allowed me the freedom to do what I wanted, which is not the case with every parent here in India. I applied to a lot of colleges and MIT was my top choice. I am indebted to my father for all that he has done and I feel miserable because I disappointed him. I wanted to get MIT most importantly for him. Even I took 6.00.1x and 6.002x from MIT and passed with great marks. None of it made any difference, but of course, whatever the odds be stacked against you, you never give up! I wish you all the very best as you continue to learn at edx and online.

<p>Rejected (That's why I'm here :P)</p><p>Maybe I was the only person from my region to apply (West Bengal, India).</p><p>I am phenomenal academically (Won 2nd prize in MITx CECC5, found a new theory of photon-electron interaction, passed various competitive edx courses like CS50), I exerted myself working for underprivileged children in my city (Kolkata), I am a teacher and content writer with an NGO Make A Difference (MAD), I am a high school Soccer player, has considerable SAT and high school grades, and I am two years out of school.</p><p>I had to go through a severe illness after graduating high school and could not join a college. Maybe this is the only drawback I have in my profile.</p><p>I applied only to top U.S. colleges because I might not be able to pay a penny ( without Schols and Fin-Aids it is impossible for my family). If I get rejected from other colleges too (Harvard, Dartmouth, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Rochester), then this might be the end of my dream to get a college education. No Indian college admits students with gap years.</p><p>I don't know what MIT wants. Maybe they are afraid that if this Physics genius comes from a faraway land, he will see, and he will conquer - all other will be gaping in awe. I don't need you! I am like Louis De Broglie; I can carry out my research sitting in my room. I will keep changing the lives of slum kids and see them excel academically and otherwise. I will keep writing for the underprivileged kids, and I will keep playing Soccer and keep swimming (need to improve on the butterfly though). I will also keep playing pranks on my friends like  I always do. My life is not ruined just because a school with pathetic servers rejected me. <br>As for college education - I am already learning a lot through edx ( Thanks Prof. Agarwal and the edx team and the universities). I am waiting for Prof. Agarwal's autographed book.</p><p>Only regret remains is that I have spent a lot of my parents money on tests and application material. My sister sacrificed a lot to compensate for the application expenses. I am indebted to them.</p><p>MIT does not deserve me (if my photon theory is proven to be correct, then it will oust Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle). Maybe I know more than anyone on campus; I can visualise sub-atomic interactions precisely.</p><p>Talked much. Application was a self exploration, learnt a lot. BYE!</p>

<p>Just like everyone else here, I was rejected today. I am a competitive swimmer, and I was hoping swimming would have enough pull to get me admitted. MIT was the perfect balance between academics and athletics for me. I'm not fast enough to make division 1 programs, which eliminates my other college choices if I want to continue to swim. I really love swimming and I don't know if I'm ready to give it up. Admission would have meant the world to me, but now I guess I have to grow up and make the best choice for me. Life isn't fair. But if it isn't fair to anyone, I guess that makes everything fair and equal again.</p>

<p>I just want to say thank you to admissions for reading my essays and getting to know me. It’s probably a difficult job sorting through people, and definitely not black and white or easy decisions. I’m not going to pretend I’m not disappointed, but let’s face it, as arrogant as I am (and I am, trust me), you guys who got in are awesome, and you really deserve it (you wouldn’t have beaten me if you weren’t . . JK). The saddest part for me is that I won’t be able to tell my favorite chemistry professor that I got in - I really wanted to make her proud. But there are other ways to make the people I admire proud, and when you think about it, there’s really nothing to be ashamed of. So I wasn’t the best of the best, but is that really a terrible thing, in the grand scheme of things? Do I really have to be, to be proud of who I am? No. Is MIT even a measure of whose the best of the best? No. What I am proud of is that I gave my best effort, and at least I can tell myself that, because that is what matters.<br>To all of us who didn’t get in, let’s go into other universities and be badass from there!  We’re still awesome, and that online notification was neither designed to or intended to tell us any different. Let’s make our mark regardless of what graduation ring we wear!<br>To those who got in - Congratulations will all my heart! I really hope you enjoy it there, and that you will go far and take full advantage of your opportunities - and I’m sure you will!<br>I’ll be wishing you the absolute best of luck as a CheE major at Viriginia Tech!</p>

<p>My first reaction when I discovered I'd been rejected was similar to yours--why didn't they just reject me EA and tell me to get on with my life, instead of making me wait 3 more months for the same answer. But as I thought and pondered more, I became strangely grateful for the turn of events.</p><p>First off, I don't think I was emotionally ready to be rejected back in December. I think it would have crushed my feeble dreams and deterred me from applying to other competitive schools RD because I got rejected from one.</p><p>However, and more importantly, I'm glad I was deferred because of all I've learned in the past three months. Had I been rejected, I would have blocked the MIT admissions page on my browser and tried to keep myself off the blogs. Instead, I've read every single blog since December and gained insight not only into MIT but life itself. Even just last night I learned an incredible, valuable lesson from Ceri's old blog about the perfect pie (<a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmitadmissions.org%2Fblogs%2Fentry%2Fjust-desserts%29%3AEptt2J7uuREeQGhjpi_XIy2VqCo&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/just-desserts)">http://mitadmissions.org/bl...</a> which I would REALLY SUGGEST that fellow rejectees read) and it helped me deal with today's news very well.

<p>That was me when I saw me EA deferral last semester. Given they accept ~3% deferred, I knew it was a  death sentence. I cried for hours, walking through my neighborhood with my headphones playing depressing music. But you know what? Looking back I realized MIT was only my first choice because of the HYPE surrounding it, not because of evidence or case study. A lot of people I met thought I was too liberal artsy to enjoy such a science intensive school. And to be honest, the fish in the MIT pond aren't just big, they are ginormous!!! These are the gods of math and science! It would be a little discouraging to people like me to go to a school with such power and intensity. So I have looked back and seen that the Admissions Committee did not just reject me for their sake, but for mine as well. They just pushed me (albeit shockingly) in a better direction IMHO!!</p>

<p>MIT was my dream ever since I was seven years old, and I bet it was many other's as well. As just a Chinese girl in a big high school in Arizona, I always thought there was no chance I would be able to escape this hot desert and go somewhere on the East Coast, but maybe there would be if I got accepted. I visited the campus my sophomore year and fell in love, and even cried some happy tears in hope that I would attend this wonderful school (weird, but might as well tell everyone the truth here). So being rejected was a hard thing for me to swallow, but I realized it's not the end of the world and I hope none of you guys feel that way either. You are all so amazing, and every single one of you will succeed somewhere, as long as you don't let one "failure" consume you. I used to do that, thinking if I didn't succeed at something big, my life would be over. But I know you guys are fantastic, talented, strong, and you won't let this ruin your life (maybe just your day, then go eat some cake and feel better). I hope all the success in your future endeavors, and maybe you'll get into other colleges who I know have a decision date of March 31! Have a wonderful day to all of you :)</p>

<p>Like most of you reading this thread, I was rejected. And like a large number of you, MIT was my top choice and dream school. Perhaps you were drawn to MIT because of the strength of a course there, or because of the University's pristine reputation, the beautiful campus or the amazing faculty, I know I was, or perhaps you were drawn to MIT for one of the other countless features that make MIT amazing. Maybe you came from a distant foreign country and spent months trying to improve your english to try and impress the admissions people, or maybe you live just down the street from MIT. Regardless I know you're probably not very happy right now.  Believe me, I know how you feel. Take solace in the fact that just applying to MIT probably means you're an amazing student, and while this door has closed for you there are many others for exceptional students like you. And finally be happy with the fact that you had the courage to apply in the first place. You screwed your courage into the sticking place, so to speak, and applied to MIT despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly against you, be happy that you'll be able to live with the knowledge that you tried, rather than with the nagging curiosity of what might had been if you applied. I've always believed that you should always aim for the moon, because even if you miss you'll be among the stars. Well we missed this time, but all of us are bound for great things and this is just a hurdle along the way.</p>

<p>Long before I thought about applying to MIT, long before it was one of the places I wanted to end up in, University of Pennsylvania was more or less my everything. It was a school of ostensible power in the US; it was symbolic of higher chances, of opportunities greater than anything I had experienced within the confines of Nigeria, and thus my attraction to Penn was almost religious. They had sent me mail saying they wanted me to apply. I did. Held  my breath. Spent hours of days daydreaming, seeing the walks I would take in its quad, the lush beautiful campus on whose grass I would lay, the students of intellect with whom I would bond. Penn was a pinnacle of conscious desires and unformed ambition--it was just the only place I could be, I told myself.</p><p>And then I got rejected. Generic letter saying no. I stared at it for who knew how long with a lump in my throat. This couldn't be the conclusion. This couldn't be the end. What went wrong? Low GPA? Not enough extracurriculars? The questions hovered in my mind, alongside a festering resentment. I told myself that I had missed my one true chance.  For what? Even that I didn't know. Just felt like I had missed "it".</p><p>I'm here now, in MIT, and the past year and half here have been among the most wonderful, most powerful and most rewarding years of my life.  And the point of this comment isn't the specificity of MIT's greatness; it's the specificity of hindsight I'd have appreciated knowing at the time of rejection. It was eventually seeing that even when things feel like they are the end of a road--a road that may to you have been "the only road"--you should know it's not true. You're the kind of person that applied to MIT, which tells me that they're so many roads that diverge from this one day, each full of potential. When it does come, this day will re-emerge briefly in memory as a tiny cog in the great wheel that is now your story.  Once upon a time, I saw a letter of rejection that felt like the end of my world. But it simply put me on another road, one I certainly didn't think existed at the time, and one which has been more rewarding than any sequence of words could possibly paint. Today, you're staring at some letter that says no. Well guess what this means. It means your road to something different and powerful and amazing is on the way. This isn't the end. It's the beginning.</p>

<p>Ahhhh no I'm so sorry. I did not mean it in any negative way. :(</p><p>If MIT could admit all the people who are qualified to go to MIT and deserve to go to MIT, the freshman class would be bigger than the entire current undergrad population. There just aren't enough spaces to admit everyone who should be here. It's terrible, and I really, really hope that the path you guys carve for yourselves is amazing. Come back for grad school (or don't; grad school seems stressful). Not only will MIT regret this decision ten years from now, MIT regrets it now. Like I said, I hope that someday everyone who deserves an MIT education will be able to get one. :(</p>

<p>The key is to apply to somewhere just slightly less selective. It's like retail therapy- as soon as you get rejected from here, you start paying attention to all of the notes begging you to choose them and the t-shirts and mugs... For me Smith makes me feel better. The Dean has taken to writing me hand-written notes. Sure, MIT was my dream, and a few months ago I would have fallen into a deep depression and wanted to die... But now I am totally okay. Let them court you, because you are awesome and will be awesome wherever you go.</p>

<p>This is my first post on the MIT blogs. I had read some before, but never posted to any of them. School work comes easy to me, and I had high hopes for getting into this amazing school for the challenging coursework and great community. I applied Early Action, but a fiasco with my interviewers led to me being diverted to Regular Action. Everyone I knew encouraged me along and told me that I was sure to get in. I was excited and nervous for decisions to arrive. As you may have guessed by the blog I'm posting in, I was not admitted. I won't lie… it hurts a lot. Not because I was denied, but because I feel I may have failed all the people who seem to have believed in me so much. I won't let this stop me, and I have applied to other colleges. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Thank you MIT for inspiring me to follow my dreams, even if I didn't make it, I congratulate all those who did. Keep on trucking all of you awesome people.</p>

<p>Hey, just wanted to drop by as an EA reject to give you all what I hope will be some words of encouragement.</p><p>Like many of you, I was incredibly invested in MIT. I walked the halls over the years, met with professors to talk research, ran to Flour to get sticky buns with friends, snuck into the Media Lab at 3am to get hot chocolate, helped make food for dorm Thanksgiving celebrations…</p><p>Like many of you, I applied not just for the coursework, but for the people – people just as weird, just as nerdy, and just as human as I am.</p><p>And like many (most) of you, I was rejected.</p><p>I know it hurts. A lot. But I promise you that this isn’t the end. It’s not all downhill from here. You can still be friends with anyone and everyone you had hoped to know – none of my friends at MIT have vanished. Everyone is still here. No one’s stopping you from emailing professors to nerd out. No one.</p><p>I have a lot of hopes for you. I hope you don’t resent your high school years – this decision doesn’t define the value of what you’ve done or who you are. Don’t let it. I hope you fall in love with another amazing school and start to dream about their programs, their initiatives, their people. And, in time, I hope you come to remember why you applied to MIT – there really should be a Tea and Sympathy rule for college admissions: years from now, when you speak of this – and you will – be kind. Admissions officers are people too, and I promise someone in that office was rooting for you. Trust me.</p><p>Please remember that everyone who was admitted deserves to have been admitted – but not everyone who was rejected deserves to have rejected.</p><p>Be proud of yourselves. This isn’t the end; it’s the beginning.</p><p>I’m rooting for you.</p><p>Courtney</p>
