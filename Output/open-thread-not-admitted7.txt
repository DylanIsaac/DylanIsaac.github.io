<p>I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. Even if MIT was the thing you had been working toward, the accomplishments you've collected so far in your life are still yours, and the community you've built around you, and the people you've helped—those are all still there, and they're still important and good and you're important to them. Applying to MIT is a hard thing to do, and it's a brave thing to do, and rejection is not easy, especially when you put so much of yourself into the application.</p><p>I hope you can find a way to channel your passion into the larger goals and growth and dreams that inspired you to apply to MIT in the first place. Achieving those dreams is bigger than a college acceptance letter, if perhaps less immediate (and likely more difficult). If you can't find a community where you feel you belong, I hope you find a way to build one, and to lift up other people who might have felt that way too. Your life is leading to far bigger things than a college decision letter—this is just the first step. Best of luck.</p>

<p>I knew this was coming, but it still hurts more than anything else I've ever experienced. It legitimately feels like I don't have much of a point anymore. Everything my life was leading to, everything I ever wanted, destroyed in an instant. And I know that you may say that there's other places to achieve these dreams, but MIT was the only place where I really ever felt I would belong and be able to pursue what I want from life. I'm at such a loss and don't know what to do now...</p>

<p>I am rejected. I had done everything that was available in my region for going to MIT. The same as all of you, MIT was a part of my dream.<br>After each failure, I spend my time on thinking about the reasons. I couldn’t find any problem that was my responsibility. When I was reviewing my dreams I realized that maybe MIT wasn’t the place for achieving them. I found 14 reasons for not going MIT! I hadn’t pay attention to most of them. Some of you may have the same attitude. So, congratulations. We are still in the way of getting our dreams. We may miss some funny days in MIT, but our goals are more important. We can move faster toward our dreams now.<br>I encourage you to think deeply on your goals more deeply. Maybe you are like me!</p>

<p>Thank you, Lydia! I posted some of my thoughts in a reply above, but I'd like to add one more thought -- MIT's admissions office is without a doubt the kindest, and most personal I have encountered in my college search for the past year. I'm touched and honored to have been a part of the process and to have had a portion of my life story read and understood by the admissions committee. I do believe, more so now than ever before, that everything happens for a reason -- perhaps I'll become involved with MIT in grad school, in my career, through my children one day, or maybe our paths will diverge. Whatever the case, I harbor no bitter feelings of any kind and hold the deepest respect for both MIT and its admissions team.</p><p>I hope that, even if it was just an anecdote I related or a joke I told, my application materials were able to have some kind of impression on just one soul in your office.</p><p>(I'm also realizing that it's late at night and has been a tough day, and my thoughts probably lack cogency -- so I'll sign out here.)</p>

<p>Thank you! Perhaps my path is just taking longer to intersect with MIT than hoped for -- I'm sure I'll be applying when it comes time for grad school. In any case, I don't regret any part of the process, and I'm incredibly thankful for MIT's attitude to admissions. While it is difficult to accept the duality of believing in merit and accepting only a percentage of qualified students, I believe I'm coming to terms with it -- I'm not going to be internalizing this decision as a reflection on my ability as a student, and I respect MIT's efforts to create a small class from a huge pool of wonderful people.</p>

<p>As much as the decision hurts to hear, I have to say that going through the application really helped me reflect on who I am, what I have done, and where I want to go.

<p>I am an international student studying in the US for a year and a half. And I have to say a lot of things has changed since the day I got here. I was pretty much having nothing to do with my life. But things started going a different way as I discovered more and more options for my future path. And MIT is one of those options.</p><p>During my junior year, I considered attending a community college or a college with a high acceptance rate because I thought I was incapable. I, in fact, knew nothing about how grades or activities affect my college process. Despite getting all A and A+ in my classes, I thought I was really stupid compared to the mass (part of it because I thought I was new, so my classes should be easy). Then, I got 1080 on my PSAT and 1180 on my SAT. Those were two of the hardest tests I had ever taken.</p><p>But things started to change when I spent more time practicing SAT on Khan Academy, I increased my SAT score by 220. I took the SAT two times. For me, a guy with a low-to-average english skill who had been in a english-speaking country for a year and rarely spoken an english word, to be able to get that score is a GODDAMM miracle.</p><p>Anyway, I thought to myself maybe I was something. I got more knowledge on the grades and other academic stuff. I thought maybe I could push for MIT because it was the only college I felt like I was in love with (and other motivations which I won't mention). I did and I am here, with other fallen comrades, writing my thoughts. Back to the story, I only had MIT and a safe college on my college list during my early senior year. I was all in for MIT.</p><p>But as I discovered more college options, even though MIT was still my dream school and will always be, I thought maybe I could go for that school which has a good program but is not so competitive compared to MIT in term of the admission process.</p><p>Recently, while satisfying myself by procrastinating on watching youtube videos, I saw this guy's channel "Joma". He was working at Buzzfeed, Linkedin, Facebook,... He emphasizes on experience rather than having a degree which really makes me think. Maybe I'd like to work and learn than study and learn. So, getting lots of internship is rather a great way to gain experience.</p><p>As I discover new things, I change my perspective a bit on what I want to do with my future. There are a lot more options than you might think.</p><p>Disclaimer: This is just my personal thoughts and experience that I wanted to share. I'm trying to tell anybody to do or think the way I do.</p>

<p>Rejection is a feeling that is not novel to me. I knew that MIT was one of the top choices for schools I wanted to attend, but after submitting the application and always thinking about the opportunities it had, I have come to learn that MIT is in fact the school I wanted to attend. However, after the end of the first semester of my senior year which has become my worst semester academically, my confidence in being accepted to MIT began to fade. Though I anticipated rejection, finally receiving it still left me distraught.</p><p>I have long learned to accept the outcome of any endeavor I have pursued, for even if it is no the outcome I want, there is always something to take away from it whether it is a new skill learned along the way or a resolve to improve. Despite this, I simply cannot help but look back on my high school career and ponder about my missed opportunities and how they would have changed my outcome if I had taken them. Had I joined the robotics team on the first meeting instead of a week later, I could have joined the subgroup I wanted and perhaps be as obsessed of the team much as the rest of my friends. Had I asked a question to that guest speaker, I could have been inspired to do more for my community. Had I worked a harder on an essay, I could have earned that internship and expand my interests. It is important to look to the past to chart one's course for the future, but is more important to accept the past one already has rather than forging a new one.</p><p>I am not sure if anyone will read this, but if you are a person like me who has endured through hard work, notable achievements, and devastating failures, I implore you to continue your endeavors and aspirations. I too am sad about my rejection to MIT, but just like every rejection I have received in the past, I do not want to suppress it. Like in any well designed science experiment, one should accept the results, even if it was not what was intended; you can always learn from the mistakes or realizations from that experiment and apply it to the next one you choose to conduct. If you applied to a competitive university such as MIT, it means that you are motivated enough and confident enough in your field of interest to want to continue your studies and make your mark however you wish.</p><p>I encourage all that did not receive an offer of admission to remember and celebrate your accomplishments. Use it as your motivation to improve and conquer any challenges that you will experience in the future. To my fellow applicants, I wish you well on your journey through the sea of knowledge, discovery, and innovation on whatever you are searching for, and to the MIT admissions board, I would like to thank you for taking the time to consider me and the twenty thousand other applicants for admission.</p><p>"However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at." -- Stephen Hawking</p>

<p>I have to admit, in the first couple hours of opening my decisions, the rejection stung a lot. <br>I'm sometimes plagued with an inferiority complex, that always tells me that I'm not good enough, or that I'm a failure, and unfortunately, the rejection brought up feelings like that in me again (ie. why didn't you study math more and become an IMO gold medalist, or etc.).<br>But then, as I reflected (and ate some Ice cream haha, thanks Hunter for that idea), I realized that the rejection didn't really mean that I was worthless, or not good enough. <br>I think even if you were rejected, you probably have people who look up to you in your community and people who you inspire every day. This was especially true for me, as I know that many of my neighbors often come knocking on my door in the middle of the night (sometimes as late as 11 PM!) asking for help on their math homework and often I oblige. When I go and tutor at my middle school, there are a few kids who shout out, "Hey, I know that kid! He teaches me chess!"</p><p>I don't know any one of your guys' situations, so I can't really speak to you words of comfort, or words that you probably need to hear. We all have our own ways of dealing with rejection and our own doubts, and so it would be very shallow of me to just say, "I'm sorry to hear that, I'm sure you are smart, and have a bright future". But what I do know, is that you have all impacted your communities, or gotten through significant challenges, or taken rigorous courses, in a way that I'm sure that you all can be proud of.</p><p>Getting rejected from MIT is probably nothing compared to the things that you have already done in your life thus far.  What's in a name anyways?</p>

<p>Hey friend, I was also rejected, and contrary to my own expectations, I felt nothing but a bit of confusion and relief. I've come to see over these arduous 6 months or so that there really is something to the idea that everything happens for a reason and really, honestly, where you go to college has such little impact on the rest of your life. I'm interning in a physics department this year, and just today I was having a conversation with a wonderful guy there about college. He's been in the department for close to 15 years, and he's become essentially the go-to guy for any issue from programming to theoretical physics. I assumed -- from some conversations I must have misheard -- that he had went to the school for undergrad and decided to stay on in a research capacity.</p><p>Today, I learned that he didn't go to college at all.</p><p>While his story is certainly in the more exceptional of cases, I think it goes to show you that your zip code between the months of August and May for the next four years doesn't take anything away from who you are, and in fact, doesn't really give you much either. MIT's decision says nothing about your intellect, your ability, or your destiny to thrive in whatever field you may choose.</p><p>TL;DR: You'll get a great education anywhere because honestly, you make it for yourself, the school you go to doesn't.</p><p>(Sorry for the rant)</p>

<p>It's funny. I remember first reading about MIT for the first time when I was about five, flipping through Scientific American. Then, in 7th grade, I met my best friend--- we didn't know much about college, but she mentioned that her sister went here. I was pretty amazed that a place in a magazine and pop culture was actually real.</p><p>I skimmed the blogs faithfully and laughed at the MIT Confessions Facebook Page. I did my extracurriculars, worked hard in class, with this "maybe MIT" thing in the back of my head. Then, in December, I had the interview and submitted the application... and here we are today..</p><p>As a kid from the middle of nowhere, hearing about MIT and the brilliant things humanity can do made me look elsewhere, consider more options, and really sort of matured me into thinker I was today. So thank you.</p>

<p>This process has become so much more cathartic for me since being deferred in the EA round. I was always told that admissions decisions in the academic echelon of MIT/ivies/etc don't really make sense -- a friend of mine was denied everywhere except Penn and is thriving there. And after receiving a likely letter from an ivy a couple days ago and a rejection from MIT today, I definitely understand the lack of logic -- touting "meritocracy" is little more than an advertising campaign. So, c'est la vie.</p>

<p>After looking at my decision, I felt a sense of relief and happiness. Although I didn't get it, at least I now knew the result.</p><p>Anyway, I just want to say thank you for letting me have a chance to apply here. It was a fantastic journey from August to Pi Day. The questions, the interview, the blogs, they are all awesome! I will continue to follow MIT innovations through the news I read every day and look forward to cool new inventions from you guys!</p><p>Congratulations to people who get admitted, you truly deserve it, I hope you will have a great experience at MIT for the next 4 years. For people who didn't get in like me, it is really sad to know the truth . But you know what, keep going, because in my opinion, the graph of life always has a positive slope, even when it feels like it doesn't.</p>

<p>Wow... 4 months ago I was sitting in New Zealand (I'm from Germany) and flew home head over heels because initially I banned the thought of MIT from my mind and settled for a ("boring") life and Uni in Germany but I couldn't shake it off because MIT feels like everything I ever dreamed of and I knew I had to try now or regret it forever... waitlisted for the SATs, I flew home the next day and had 4 days to prepare after being out of school for a year... I knew I kind of had no chance but it sucks... MIT, I still love you and I'll try my hardest to see you one day but it's kind of sad sitting here after you've got your hopes up, and imagining about 20,000 others feeling like you do right now. I don't want to sound bitter, even though we probably all are right now, it didn't happen and that's okay, we'll find our way and so to all of you who feel like I do: we got this and as a (freaking) intelligent man once said (about disproving scientific theories): "... but you can always question the competence of the person who carried out the observation." we'll never know...

<p>Well, that was a hard letter to read.</p><p>MIT has been a dream for me since I was twelve, and I really fell in love with the spirit and community around the school over the last couple of years. Shoutout to the admissions bloggers—you were my inspiration throughout my last two years of high school, and a continuous source of both valuable wisdom and useless facts.</p><p>I'm not sure where I'm going from here. It's tempting to grasp at straws and apply for the waitlist, but I don't want to waste the time of the valiant admissions staff as they wade through their inboxes after Pi Day. Is it worth requesting to be considered for the waitlist, or will I not be seriously considered as a rejected applicant?</p>

<p>First of all, assuming this is a legitimate post, congratulations on achieving a successful career as a scientist and very lucky to have gotten admitted to one of the best graduate schools in this country in your field of study.  This is good for rejected students to know - that not getting into MIT or any other school shouldn't ruin any future academic or professional plans.  However, MIT didn't necessarily reject you because you "couldn't do it" or "weren't good enough."  It wasn't a wrong decision.  There are other qualities besides a high school record and knowing the meaning of the word sanctimonious that can earn a student an offer of admissions -  the intangible qualities.  You are good enough to be a top scientist today but weren't the best fit as an MIT undergraduate 8 years ago.  And just because you are a top scientist doesn't mean that you would fit at MIT as an undergraduate today.  Scientific teams aren't trained as undergraduate admissions specialists.  Don't fully blame the MIT admissions process.</p>

<p>MIT was the first university ever that I wanted to go to. I don't want to sound too dramatic but it was almost like falling in love at first sight. It was also the only school that I knew without doubt that I'd go to if I got accepted. Maybe it's because of that. Maybe there's a school that fits me better that I never realized yet, and there's nothing wrong with either of us but our paths weren't meant to cross. Maybe it happened for something better.<br>High school taught me that if things are meant to happen, it happens no matter what and how small the chances seem. And if things are not meant to happen, it never happens no matter how much you try. No matter what happens, we just have to improvise, adapt, and overcome.</p>

<p>Thank you guys so much! There were so many colors brushing through my mind, emotions I've never seen before on my pallette. I felt this all exactly four months ago, but it's not painful this time. It doesn't hurt as much! I'm not even crying. I think reading so many blog posts about the process has finally made me believe MIT is just another place. I didn't miss a shot or fail to reach a certain score--my colors don't blend well with MIT. Maybe MIT is too gray for me (I mean it's REALLY gray in reality anyway). For now, I'll take the colors MIT gave me: intense anticipation, absolute humility, greater self-perception. And I'll color the wind. I'll color it something beautiful, something better than any canvas MIT could have provided me. I feel good. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

<p>MIT was essentially my only chance I had to live out the rest of my life feeling great (at least from my emotional perspective). I'm suffering from a really bad brain disease, and I only wanted to go to MIT to finish up writing my book on a new approach to computational neuroscience (before, well, something potentially bad happens to me that prevents that process from happening). Oh well, I just want everyone to know that no matter who you are, success comes through what you do, not the college you go to. You can still do something great without the help of MIT, and the college you go to doest't define your intelligence.

I'm going to the best grad school in the world for my field of study. I've published 20 peer-reviewed papers over the past 2 years, and have garnered over 100 citations. That's 100 scientific teams that disagreed with MIT undergraduate admissions and saw value in my work.</p><p>Don't believe the hype or the bullshit about "meritocracy". Because guess what? I'd wager that it turns out high school record is a pretty terrible predictor of future scientific success.</p><p>(Here's the type of sanctimonious attitude I'm referencing, in case anybody's confused: <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmitadmissions.org%2Fblogs%2Fentry%2Fjust-to-be-clear-we-dont-do-legacy%3AJhwQD4-M5rnmenMzWDRuRUb8N8w&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/just-to-be-clear-we-dont-do-legacy">http://mitadmissions.org/bl...</a> <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhy-is-MIT-at-the-top%3As-8CZwluhxgv4SnbYc5HHyu7xVA&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-MIT-at-the-top">https://www.quora.com/Why-i...</a> .

<p>I wasn't going to respond in this thread, because my emotions are pretty much as you would expect when you get rejected from the school you dreamed about going to from the first time you visited Boston and stood in the infinite corridor in second grade. But the reality and gravity of this statement has an ironic humor that really makes me okay with the outcome of decisions. Thank you!</p>

<p>I was kinda shocked that I was rejected, but oh well, I'll try the slower way to reach my goals. I remember some old man I met at the subway (it was just recently, maybe a couple of days ago) who was really good at sudoko's (maybe not professional level though). In the time I was with him he told me to try to solve the sudoko. When I couldn't solve it as fast as him, he told me that I'm too stubborn to make something work and that I should go where I can actually fill the numbers. I guess I shouldn't have been too stubborn to make MIT work. I'll find another way to reach my goals. Maybe a more natural way would be much better.<br>Another thing that I'm interested in is if you've managed to solve the riddle that the applicants gave you. You know, the gift that we were supposed to give MIT. It was the thing that made me believe in teamwork, where it wasn't that possible here in Iran. If you've managed to solve it, I'll be as happy as when I'd been accepted to MIT (I hope this sentence is grammatically correct xD).<br>Anyway, congratulations to all those who were accepted :D</p>

<p>Thank you for considering me. MIT is my dream school, but it will have to be that - a dream - for a little longer. Even though I was not admitted (thank you for introducing this language instead of "rejected"), my love for the school has not diminished. I think that mostly, I feel peace, because I finally have that constant wondering off my chest. See you guys for grad school :)</p>

<p>I don't know what happened - I must admit, I'm not surprised. I had prepared myself for the worst, hoping for the best, you know? And yet, I never really ever pictured myself somewhere other than MIT. I remember creating my MyMIT account nearly 4 years ago - I knew then that I didn't want to go anywhere else. It was the dream.</p><p>Over the years though, I think I've come to understand something. MIT isn't a place so much as a philosophy. It's something you carry with you. In that way, I think I've experienced MIT before, and in that way, I think I'll experience it again some day - at another campus, with other people, but still, with that same drive and spirit. Dreams can change. In fact, they should - otherwise, what differentiates a person from, say,  a rock?</p><p>Congrats to those who were admitted. Fill in for us, and do what we couldn't - just remember us, and know that we're behind you guys. One day, we'll be right there beside you.</p>
