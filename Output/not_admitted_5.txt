<p>It&#8217;s not really fair to share outliers with people. We&#8217;ve hit that critical point where SO many people are applying that more people have to be rejected, but in the past (and typically) it hasn&#8217;t been that way, and it&#8217;s been approximately equal.</p>

<p>Denied. I was also denied entry into NYU, which bites. In MIT&#8217;s case, however, I suppose I expected being denied. In any case, it looks like it&#8217;s a second-rate college for me! =D</p>
<p>The least that schools could do is give a bit of criteria as to WHY you weren&#8217;t accepted. It makes the denial a bit easier on a person, I suppose, instead of the generic &#8220;You were good, but not good enough&#8221; spiel.</p>

<p>&#8220;EA Decisions&#8221;<br />
In a year of record early action applications, 590 students have been admitted to the MIT Class of 2014.</p>
<p>There were 5,684 Early Action applicants this year, representing a 13% increase over last year&#8217;s record. The deep applicant pool, combined with a commitment to maintaining equity between early and regular action admissions, meant that only 10.4% of applicants were admitted. An additional 3,893 applicants were deferred to regular action, where their applications will be reviewed anew.</p>

<p>@Yaanu: that&#8217;s really a lot of work you&#8217;re asking from all the admissions officers =( They literally read through thousands of applications, and to write comments on every single one would take them forever. In addition, a lot of times it&#8217;s really hard to pinpoint exactly why you were not accepted, and I find it a bit unreasonable to ask the admissions office to put into bulleted points why you weren&#8217;t &#8220;good enough&#8221;.</p>
<p>That being said, many people who are rejected aren&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;not good enough&#8221; for MIT, it&#8217;s just admissions feels you may be better suited to another school. Don&#8217;t despair, there&#8217;s a ton of awesome colleges out there (with better financial aid, *coughcough*). And there&#8217;s always grad school. Good luck to everyone!</p>

<p>@ anon 9:50am &#8211; if you have not figured out by now that MIT does not admit students based on their numbers, you may not have read the enormous amount of information available on the website regarding the selection process.</p>
<p>After qualifying numbers (700+ on SATs in Math, Critical Reading and such), the most important aspect considered in admission to MIT is the match between you and MIT. This portion of the website says it all:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/pulse/the_match_between_you_and_mit/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/pulse/the_match_between_you_and_mit/index.shtml</a></p>

<p>There were schools from which multiple students were accepted. However, the other students at your school have basically no bearing on you, at least in the sense you mean. </p>

<p>For all the applicants posting here, and especially @Anonymous 9:58 PM:</p>
<p>Is this disappointing? Absolutely. Does it hurt? Definitely. Will it take a while to get over? Indubitably.</p>
<p>Will you do so? Yes. Will you get an incredible education somewhere else? Yes. With memories to last a lifetime? Yes. Even if you never transfer to MIT or go there for graduate school? Yes.</p>
<p>I know how you feel; I got accepted to MIT off the wait list. In a way, getting turned down would have been easier, as that would have put an end to the uncertainty and anxiety, and I could have put it behind me and moved on. Not to mention losing a sizable non-refundable deposit to another school!</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve studied at other top-notch universities in my graduate studies and postdoctoral work, worked as a professor at the Canadian equivalent of a U.S. Research I university (of which MIT is one), and currently hold an endowed chair at yet another university. I&#8217;ve also been on the Educational Council for years, and have interviewed many applicants (although none for Early Action this year).</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve seen a lot of academia. And I can definitely say that you can get a top-notch education that&#8217;ll be well respected worldwide at many universities, as long as you put your energy and drive into it, as you did in working your heart out in high school to reach this point, and to applying for colleges.</p>
<p>Every place has its ups and downs. Even MIT. Nothing against the place, but I couldn&#8217;t wait to leave after 5 years (I stayed for my master&#8217;s) and go to a &#8220;real school&#8221; to see what that was like (you know, with a Division I football team and traditional spirit, that kind of stuff). And yes, I&#8217;d do it all over again.</p>
<p>So hold your head high! Not being admitted to MIT is not the end of the world, and nothing to be ashamed of. The pain will pass, but the world is still your oyster, as long as you apply yourself and work hard.</p>

No doubt all these students are exceptional, so why does MIT even feel the need to point out stats that are clearly meant to show the school is progressive in its admissions policy.

<p>MIT values diversity of all types, be it racial, economic, geographic, political, or otherwise. I say this to point out that there is no &#8220;other&#8221; 36% of the population. Adding up those numbers does not leave a chunk of &#8220;regular people&#8221; in our pool, because some of those women are FGC, and some of those underrepresented minorities have parents with graduate degrees, and so on and so forth. These forms of diversity cut across all individuals. In your example, for instance, the midwest is underrepresented in our applicant pool, and thus applicants from the midwest offer a desirable diversity that we look upon favorably. It&#8217;s just another piece in the puzzle. </p>
<p>More than anything else, I can assure you that while there are many reasons that a student might fail to be offered admission into MIT, not being &#8220;diverse&#8221; enough is emphatically not one of them. </p>
<p>I have removed posts which personally attacked you because they are not appropriate for this forum. I did think they were good points that further illustrated my argument, however, so if &#8220;a mom&#8221; and &#8220;Philosoraptor&#8221; would like to post their anecdotes again then I think that would help alleviate any misunderstandings that may persist.</p>

<p>After I drink a soda, I wash out the bottle, peel off the label (keep sake), and recycle it. What I do with the label is put it in a box where I keep all the labels of sodas I see are delicious, different and colorful. I&#8217;ve grown quit a large diverse collection of these tiny excerpts of what the sodas represent. However! if the label is something I really don&#8217;t appreciate (polar bears drinking soda, that&#8217;s just inhumane) I will not collect it. What I definitely don&#8217;t do is look at where it was bottled. The way I see it is that where ever it was bottled, thought went into that. Lots of time with the artists, recipe makers, and bottlers went into its construction. If a soda came from Cambodia, and was Okay, it satisfied my thirst, and had a mediocre label it probably would not enter my library of sticky paper labels soley on the fact it&#8217;s Cambodia (I have not tried Cambodian soda, but I am up for it if anyone sends P.O. Box 516 =D) . To disregard other equally (and even more)deserving labels based upon their location of manufacturing would seem.. well discriminatory. For it is the overall presentation that is exhibited that makes the soda shine. If there is an interesting quirk, obvious shiny part, even a mislabel (intentional, and non intentional)it will enter my box. What I&#8217;m getting at is, I don&#8217;t put labels in my box because they&#8217;re foreign, but because their cool. In fact now I&#8217;m tearing off the label to a jolt cola electric blue (I need the caffeine for finals, it&#8217;s my second favorite soda) and I have over 20 of them. I love it&#8217;s flavor and presentation. Anyways, I just thought you might want to know that. Sorry for the gramatical errors, I&#8217;m kind twitchy from the energy spike (glucose + caffeine = bad writer).</p>

<p>We happen to think that choosing between meritocracy and diversity is bad, too. Fortunately with the astounding group of students that apply to MIT we can instead choose both, because we think that both are vitally important to the culture and community of the Institvte. True meritocracy breeds diversity. No one is admitted to MIT without earning that place, and no one is turned away simply because of who they are. We work very, very hard to balance every part of an application and choose the best class. That&#8217;s often difficult and always painful given the small admit rate. </p>
<p>As an admissions officer I sincerely hope you don&#8217;t take our decision as a sign that you somehow failed, but rather that MIT might not be the best place for you (for many reasons that may have little to do with how brilliant or gifted you are). But never for a moment think that the only reason we would or wouldn&#8217;t admit someone to MIT is because of race, gender, religion, economics, culture, address or any of the hundreds of small-minded thorns that spring from prejudice. We simply don&#8217;t work that way, and our past admissions statistics demonstrate it.</p>

<p>The Angler fish is a beautiful specimen. In the deepest parts of the ocean it extends a light from the curtains of a cold dark heavily pressured world. As a curious organism approaches that beacon a hypnosis of safety and warmth lures it further. Ultimately it&#8217;s impaled by the jagged teeth of the Angler. The victim is then reverted back into darkness.</p>

<p>One ture story to those who were not admitted &#8211; One international student who won 2005 IChO gold medal was rejected by MIT in 2006. 3 years later, he graduated from Rice and was admitted to MIT this fall (2009) as a PhD student in Chemistry. So, this is just a beginning, not a final yet. Good luck&#8230;.</p>
