<p>Not gonna lie, I&#8217;m more than a little upset. My future is now totally unclear; I&#8217;m uncertain as to if I&#8217;m even going to be able to go to college now (some personal issues caused me to be unable to meet most other colleges&#8217; January 1st deadline). I really felt like MIT was the only college I&#8217;d ever really fit in at, and it&#8217;s been a bit of a lifelong dream of mine to come. Plus, this is just the cherry on top of a variety of other wonderful issues that have stricken my life lately, so my heartbreak is pretty intense.</p>

<p>I like the first poster&#8217;s attitude. Not in the &#8220;beating them&#8221; mentality specifically, but in the drive to go do good things even after not being accepted into MIT.</p>
<p>We should all face it, MIT is cool and awesome and it hurts to not be able to go, but heck, almost everyone who applied has immense power at their disposal to do great things&#8230; and education is something you can get no matter where you go. I&#8217;m sure nobody wants to see a bunch of non-admits with tunnel visions get bummed out cuz they didn&#8217;t get into their top school. So let&#8217;s all go out there and kick butt with awesome great powers. <img src="https://mitadmissions.org/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></p>

<p>*Sigh* This will be my first and last(maybe, I don&#8217;t pretend to know the future) post on here&#8230; I kind of knew all along that this was what was going to happen. I would be lying if I said I am not just a little disappointed right now. But you know something? I don&#8217;t regret applying at all. Found out a lot about myself, and I will always be wondering *what if* if I had listened to the naysayers and didn&#8217;t apply. Thanks MIT, you are truly one in a kind. Who knows, maybe you will see me 3-4 years from now if I try for grad school&#8230;</p>
<p>People who haven&#8217;t been admitted, we are all brothers and sisters right now-as corny as that sounds. Don&#8217;t lose heart! What some adcom says about us at 17 or 18 isn&#8217;t a life-setter. I don&#8217;t buy that, no matter what other people say. I apologize, I don&#8217;t mean to preach&#8230;</p>

<p>For those of us not admitted, there is a whole world waiting outside. We can still get an outstanding education anywhere else we choose to go. Its more about what the student does than about where he/she does it. So let&#8217;s accept it and move on. MIT, you are awesome as ever, but our love for science has not decreased one bit. Oh and yes, MIT is always a grad school option. Good luck all of us who havent got in and congrats to those who did.</p>

<p>MIT: Make It Through. Enough positive mentality to escape the mental fatality of rejection, though the top selections were chosen, yes. But we are blessed to have other options, don&#8217;t opt to angry tears, or years seemingly wasted. I can taste it! The Sun! The Moon! You will reach it one day. I&#8217;d like to congratulate the MIT Admits, who I admit, are super-qualified [and hopefully dignified enough to attend the school].

<p>Well, MIT was my top pick but&#8230;</p>
<p>I, and many others posting here, would be fooling themselves if they said they weren&#8217;t disappointed. I won&#8217;t lie, I feel pretty down after reading that letter. However, like a previous poster said, we are all capable of greatness &#8211; I mean, look, every single one of us is well qualified, intelligent, and above all, AMBITIOUS. WE ALL WANTED TO BE IN THE TOP TECH SCHOOL IN AMERICA, AND WE ALL FOUGHT TO GET IN. That, in itself, is the true worth of our attempts. While I may still a dull ache in my heart as I remember all of the times I fantasized about being on the MIT campus, I know that I &#8211; and all of you &#8211; will eventually kick this horrendously depressing feelings. I expect to read scientific/tech articles about all of you. (haha, that last line was a bit hyperbolic, but it conveys my point).</p>

While this is only through an outside perspective, I think you should lift your head up &#8211; even though you may have not been admitted to a top tier school, many, many, many other less-dreamy schools are just as venerable.

<p>All I can say is that MIT does not control our lives-we do. Sure, now we might have to work a but harder since we won&#8217;t have MIT on our resumes, but that should just make us better at what we do.</p>

I know most on this page feel the same way. And MIT Admissions, I am upset that you chose to baby the grown men and women of the high school class of 2011 by daring to write &#8220;Not Admitted&#8221; as the title of this page. Just type rejected and give it to us straight. We know. We suck in your eyes and we know that we will kick ass somewhere else. It&#8217;s okay. We still have our state schools with 100+ kids in our classes to look forward to and we are ready to kick their butts to the moon. Thanks for the ride. It ended badly.</p>

<p>Hey guys I know the let down is tough, but keep your heads up! I was rejected last year after being deferred, and I was very confused/sad during the ensuing days. I felt as if the MIT rejection meant that I wasn&#8217;t good enough to be accepted to any elite schools. In the end, you win some and you lose some. I&#8217;m sure many of you applied to many amazing schools, some of which you may have already been accepted to and most of which you will find out about in the next couple of weeks. MIT is only one of the many amazing places out there. It is totally untrue to think that a college has the ability to determine your success in life. If you have a vision of what you wish to achieve in life, nothing will stop you. Rejection often makes one stronger and more focused. Sure MIT is a great place, but everything happens for a reason. Given the huge (very qualified) applicant pool and the limited number of spots, it is absurd to take this rejection as an indicator of your potential or character. Congratulations on all of your successes, and always remember to aim high.</p>

<p>Wow. this sucks, they took no one regular round from my high school. Which is wack, because my high school is more selective than they are. I don&#8217;t understand. I just don&#8217;t get it. I&#8217;m gonna go to a great college, I&#8217;m gonna do something fantastic with my life and someday I&#8217;m gonna look back and say: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; And I&#8217;m gonna prove that.</p>

<p>Ah&#8230;.. This feels so damn bad&#8230; I screwed up my Math paper yesterday and the sole ray of my life have been snatched away from me&#8230;.. But MIT will still remain the place where I ever wanted to be. Sure to apply as a transfer student.</p>

<p>MIT you are honestly missing out on minds that could have advanced your institution by unmeasurable means.<br />

There is always a reason for everthing, and like the first post said, &#8220;If u can&#8217;t join them, beat them&#8221;. Beat them, i will.</p>

<p>I was pretty depressed about getting rejected.(By &#8220;pretty,&#8221; I mean extremely). However, some of these rather optimistic comments cheered me up (somewhat). Thanks and good luck, wherever you guys go!</p>

<p>Anyone that sees this post, help me out and test my theory. If you are a well qualified applicant (strong SATs, Schedule, GPA) Take your birth month and add your birthday (August 21= 8+21) If the resulting number is a perfect square, you should have gotten in. Prime numbers got deferred at Early Action.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I suppose I didn&#8217;t have what it took to get in this year, but I&#8217;ll just try again next year <img src="https://mitadmissions.org/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" />.</p>

<p>Well, I take that as a compliment! MIT doesn&#8217;t want me in its campus bcoz they don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ll be able to cope with it!!! Well, what can I say!</p>
<p>I feel quite lucky that atleast MIT took a look at my profile, at my life! I feel so honored☺☺☺!</p>
<p>I just wish that one day should come when MIT will remember me and will blog about me saying that a human who also didn&#8217;t get into MIT!</p>
<p>Cheers Guys!!!! Peace.</p>

<p>Off course there is the disappointment, but I&#8217;m really not as depressed as I could be. I am sure to fail that test on Taylor Series tomorrow in Calc, but whatever. Life is quite a bit more than college decisions and math tests, and academics; it&#8217;s about finding your niche and being happy- both of which can be done without MIT. Good luck to the rest of you wherever you applied, and wherever the future may take you!</p>

<p>Oh well&#8230;<br />
@David W. Hey, your theory works for me as I got a prime number and I was deferred at Early Action.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to lie, it sucked that I didn&#8217;t get in. But cmon, everyone that applied had the perfect SAT scores, the great high school grades, and all the sports and extra activities. They can&#8217;t accept everyone, and its really not that big of a deal. I&#8217;m going to to great things in life, MIT or not. Rejection is just another form of motivation.</p>

<p>You know what sucks? I actually ended up doing something super duper amazing yesterday. Maybe not compared to other guys in MIT, but if you look at my background, I&#8217;m like, the bawss. Made every international school in my city + 3-4 other cities (my city is the capital of this country) get together y asking for delegates, and now we&#8217;re going to have an inter-school chess tournament, debate tournament, programming competition, and a whole bunch of other nerdy stuff no one could ever DREAM of having in this country, let alone the city. Soo.. :D<br />
By pushing me to work harder, knowing MIT has made me a better person. <img src="https://mitadmissions.org/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /><br />
I&#8217;ll never feel bad I poured my soul into applying to MIT, and put so much dedication into my application (I literally spent less than an hour with the others, and have been accepted from 4-5 other universities, all of the ones that have replied), because in the end, it&#8217;s the people at MIT who shape it &#8211; the place does not shape the people as much as the people shape each other.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether I should cry right now. Kept telling everyone in my family that I probably will get accepted, and now I&#8217;ll start blaming myself for having done something wrong on the application&#8230;</p>
<p>Thank you anyways Admissions Officiers. 17k people are in the same situation as me right now, and I know I&#8217;m most definitely not the best of these 17k applicants, and so there&#8217;s someone even better than me who wasn&#8217;t accepted either. :((</p>

<p>@Gumpy: People at MIT are really cool. When I visited everyone was really friendly. Dont hate.</p>
<p>@Ikki Sato: That is the right attitude. Try to put a positive spin on rejection, however you can.</p>
