<p>I'm going to be honest. Unfortunately, i'd associated changing the world with you inventions to MIT. I read how inventions like the GPS or Email were born here. I thought of myself as an inventor and was hoping i could help the world with my inventions. But, oh well. This just turned my world upside down. I guess i'll have to settle for the next best thing</p>

<p>be proud of your hard work!!!! the application and the work you put in before the application. all of it was much more than college admissions—that doesn't change, and the work WILL pay off. MIT was never the destination, just a step on the way. the plan is still there, and it's still good. get through this, keep working hard, and keep putting yourself out there.</p>

<p>MIT Admissions,<br>Thank you for making the application process so smooth, and enjoyable – while admissions are often the most pressurising times in high-school, I felt very much at home on <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmitadmissions.org%3AGaLyq0IQQCFSCYfF9ZOrUeYVzYI&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="mitadmissions.org">mitadmissions.org</a>. I loved reading of your crazy adventures, both on the blogs, and the broader research news from <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmit.edu%3AE2D0nRp3XqR9zBDIZTGTxl0sDMI&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="mit.edu">mit.edu</a> – and sincerely hope I'll be part of creating them someday. Thank you very much for caring about us applicants and the broader community.</p><p>I really wish (because <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmitadmissions.org%2Fblogs%2Fentry%2Fthe_burning_question%2F%3A9s4QQU2dap56i1Y7qkm_LBpFo3A&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/the_burning_question/">this</a> post indicates there isn't) there was a way for you to tell me whether there is something obvious missing in my application, or the issue is more subjective, or I just won't be a good fit altogether.</p><p>In any case, thank you, for reading about 33 000 applications along with mine. I'll linger over here because these blogs are worth a read, and hope to forge my own path into MIT (through robotics-related research, maybe?) since this undergraduate admissions approach didn't work.</p><p>— A RD reject</p>

<p>i relate to pretty much everything here - nervously dreaming, getting forms filled, crafting essays alone at night, sibling tutoring, working to the top all by myself, applying to a place my peers probably havent heard of, even the 6 languages! your application was stellar and you know it. mit was great, but a college that recognizes your potential is even better. like someone else here said, "to dream at all is to be vulnerable". it'll take a while to dream again, for me at least. but we did more than anyone thought we could and we'll reap the rewards some day.</p>

<p>Congratulations for the succeed applicants.<br>I weren't admitted to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Whatever, Alhamdulillah, I am happy with the desire of Almighty Allah Subhana Tawla. Obviously Almighty Allah is the greatest decision maker.</p><p>But I am little bit tensed about my dreams because of economic and social limitations. My dreams are to work on 5th Dimension, remove pollution from the universe, build the world biggest cost-free hospital and so on. Already I have lost 9 years and MIT was one of the options. This long study gap impacts badly. Also I may fail in other options like Harvard, Yale, Princeton.</p><p>I don't know how I should react.

But "We will evaluate applicants individually and evaluate his achievements by understanding his/her situation", this gave me hope.

But it is "NO" to me...<br>         This is something sad. Thanks to MIT Admission Staff and bloggers for their support.   <br>      But i am still not okay with that "NO" [ only with that word "NO", not with anyone of MIT staff :) ]<br>      I will show "NO" who I am and what I can do....<br>   Be ready I am going to punch you and make you "YES".<br>      For all those who are not admitted, this rejection doesn't mean that you are unfit, it means that you still didn't bring out that great version in you.

<p>This is true! MIT offers wonderful opportunities, but so does the rest of the world. I have friends who took 5+ years to graduate from state schools who now have jobs I'd love to have and have had different but equally special and enriching opportunities for travel, work, and research. If you applied and didn't get in, you are no less intelligent, interesting, or worthy now than you would be if you had gotten in. You are still going to have adventures, and you can still find and follow a path that is rewarding, challenging, and transformative for you.</p>

<p>MIT! my very first and last dream school. <b>dear admissions officers, thank you for reviewing my application</b>. Viewing the update(my rejection letter) was painful just like it did to all those of you crying in this thread. I don't mean I'm not crying. I'm feeling low. my eyes went dark and I felt like I'm drowning. currently, I'm a little bit far from family and friends and I didn't have someone to hug me and whisper that it's all okay! it's very hard dealing with this. writing my deeeeep thoughts may take me too deeeep into the darkness. I will to let it go. i will still try to apply and apply. sure i will lookout for some other schools but my love for MIT is beyond the words of description. speaking of applying, i have very limited resources there in my country. we don't have test centers and many other things. i took myself into the pool of applicants. i had no any idea of what it was like to apply(e.g: writing an essay/ELP/standardized testing and etc.) i have been learning about applications and what to do for a year. and when the time came, i tried to do my magic but it didn't workout.</p><p>i'm feeling wretched because i think  might never see you again.</p><p>i would love to have someone Alumni or <u>whatever</u> who guides me to the best of my application.</p><p>please, hug me in the comments and...............just hug! :_(</p>

<p>You know, depending on how you look at it it's better than getting waitlisted again this weekend. I was really hoping that talking about the four colors of asparagus in my interview would seal the deal, but alas it is what it is. It's not all unfortunate though, I vented by running 3.14 miles in the shape of pi (and now I know I need to do something similar for tau day after reading <a href="http://disq.us/url?url=this%3ACJ1iEW4AdDAFPukorPni7lqp6xg&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="this">https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/in-honor-of-tau/</a>) and ate some key lime pie for dessert. Congrats to those who were accepted and perhaps I'll see some of you who weren't around sometime!</p><p>P.S. If any one who is reading this has some friends in high places consider suggesting to them adding some sort of celebration after submitting your application. Common App has fireworks that appear on the screen, but MIT could have some falling pumpkins, a Tim (good name choice btw, Mitch would have worked too but Tim has a better ring to it and it's more subtle) or two, and some other nerdy things like MITT-8 (what I call the BB-8 style droid in the Star Wars themed pi day videos).</p>

<p>I have spent much of the last five hours thinking (read: crying) about my decision. I considered myself to be a strong applicant who was passionate about stem--and I still am, I suppose--it's just that this really hurts. A lot. I'm absolutely devastated, but I have confidence that things will work out, even if things aren't at all working out right now. <br>I wanted to thank the admissions officers who not only read our applications, but also made the whole process more bearable than it could have otherwise been. In particular, I love the beautiful Gaynor song, "I Will Survive," that is here. I had honestly never even listened to it prior to today. If I receive other rejections in life--as I suspect I will--I plan on listening to it again.<br>If my life didn't have purpose before, it sure does now: to not be singularly defined by this rejection. This has given me perhaps new motivation to keep working hard and continue to push myself.</p>

<p>This is the very first time in my life that I feel like I got defeated from all the odds around. Knowing that only 3-4 students make it to MIT from all over India and the acceptance rate is below 3.5% this year, I am trying myself to consolidate but I am unable to get away from the fact that right now I am in a position where I don't deserve to be among those masterminds who made it to MIT. Well pain is an integral part of everybody's life but today I am even more grateful to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for being one of the reason that kept me alive today. It may sound funny to most of the people but yes MIT really helped me to get the most difficult situation of my life. I was in a situation where I thought of giving up but the very same day I came to know that an institution called MIT exists. I never realised how fascinated I was in Aerospace engineering and Space Science but while going through MIT's page for the very first time and while discovering the majors being taught at MIT, I understood my real interest. Like what else do you expect from an ambition less boy who was forced to be in the crowd to be someone, to do something that every other student of India does. But there was always a hope. A hope that helped me go through a lot of difficulties and hardships. Will always be ever thankful and grateful to MIT for teaching me so much about myself and helping me to transform myself into someone that I never I could be. Definitely this is not the outcome I wanted. It shattered all the efforts and hard-work I gave in order to be a part of the MIT family. But this is not the end. Not going to give up on my dreams. I will keep this post as a pinned on till the day I receive an acceptance letter for Masters/PhD/MBA at MIT. Whatever it takes!</p>

<p>Now that I've had some time to settle my emotions and all that jazz (thanks for all the hugs btw, much appreciated &lt;3), I just kinda feel sad. I thought I had a chance here, maybe that came from connecting with all the amazing bloggers (love you all btw) or maybe through some delusion of grandure on my part, but it turns out I wasn't quite enough. That being said, thanks to the AOs for all your hard work, the bloggers for making my days better over and over again, and my fellow applicants who couldn't quite read "congratulations" today.<br>It pains me to say, but I don't think I'll be active on the blogs anymore, at least for now. The emotions I'm picking up just from clicking on this page's bookmark aren't positive, but thanks for all the amazing things, from CJ's monster posts to Paolo's love for tau, these were some of the best reads of my life. Again, love you all, and I wish everyone here the best on the often rocky trail that is life. &lt;3</p>

<p>So, I did not get in. There is a part of me just thinking "who did you think you are? Why did you think you could make it?". But for the past months MIT was my life. MIT was my dream. And that is a big thing for me considering that I NEVER wished for anything. Not for Christmas, not for my birthday, <b>never</b>. I did not even have big dreams. I always told myself to just work hard enough. Just work harder... But this time wished to go to MIT; I allowed myself to <i>dream</i>. <br>I gave everything I had for this dream. Spend hours researching how to apply as an international student? Make sure your teachers write your letters? Translate all the letters? Do an English test? Get all your documents professionally translated? Sort out all of the bureaucracy? Put every last bit of your heart and story into your essays until you dream of the sentences and words? Complete the CSS profile? Do an interview? Do all of that while tutoring your little sister because of Corona? While doing tons of extracurricular stuff? While writing a research paper and teaching yourself 6 languages? <br>Sure. I did all of those things. All by myself. (There is no (working) network to support international applicants.) I did not tell anybody that I applied. Not even my best friends. I had to contact my abusive father under false pretense to get all the financial aid information. My mother did not even look at my application because she works night and day as a nurse. I spend the days in school and the nights on my application. My dream. <br>Now the worst part is not even that I didn´t get in, but that I had hope.</p><p>I got bullied in school. I had a though childhood. I was always poor. I worked myself from the very bottom to the very top of the class. I got though all of these things by myself. <br>"Finally", I thought, "finally, I made it". But now I am sitting here, all by myself again. It is morning because of the time difference and I...I do not know what to do. No one I know even applied to an international college, not like this anyways. There never was a plan B, so... I am just sitting here. <br>But hey: What doesn´t kill you makes you stronger". Right? Now, deep down I know that that is true and I am not even mad or feel treated unfairly. It just hurts so much to see this dream evaporate into nothingness... <br>Well, anyways this somehow makes me feel better. Being able to share.</p><p>So, I will continue eating marmalade out of the jar (Because I am super sportive and healthy and have no snacks. Blah, blah, blah) and wait for the sunrise before I continue with my life. And one day I will look back and see how this has made me stronger. Something like that. But currently it just SUCKS.

<p>My strong emotional bond with MIT -- the wallpapers, the blogs, youtube videos, OpenCourseWare and even the MIT apps on Playstore -- makes it really painful. I'm short of words....<br> MIT was in my night dreams and daydreams. I could envision myself walking on Ames street, Massachusetts Avenue, sitting in Barker Engineering Library, sailing on the Charles River, sitting on a mat on Killian Court (verily, MIT deserves lots of awards in Urban planning, contemporary art and architecture), taking intense Lab classes I felt I was prepared for, meeting passionate and gifted minds across diverse academic fields. I even got to know many current professors by name ( and also saved their office telephone numbers on my cellphone). This was pure obsession.<br> Now I'm sad I got too connected, too emotionally attached to such a famous Institute ( honestly, I'm just realizing how competitive and famous MIT is). And you know what's worse? I don't even have a backup plan.<br> I applied believing an MIT education will change my life, equip me with skills I need to be a better person and make the world a better place as well. I felt I had taken hold of opportunities I had to portray my contributions to science and technology in my locality by tutoring middle school and sophomore high school  students in Science and Math, organizing science clubs and also contributing to the humanities through music, but it turned out to be inefficient.<br> From the blogs I've read over the months, I've finally come to realize the kind of people MIT has as students. They are not irrationally-minded person's like I see myself now. I really respect everyone who made it in this year.(how I so much loved to be in the class of "2025")<br> Pains aside, my MIT application process is the most transparent and student-centered application i've ever done. The AO's are wonderfully kind and responsive to emails. You guys actually got me thinking you were all interested in me with the way you responded to my mails. It was a lovely experience. I actually want some more in the future, and for this reason, it's not over yet. Though I understand that being an INTERNATIONAL APPLICANT is exceptionally tough, I'll be back to meet you next year stronger than ever.<br> And did I tell you that those essay questions were the most psychological demanding?  They definitely triggered maturity and situational awareness within me.<br>Thank you so much for the experience. At least that's what I have left to take home.</p>

<p>Bad news... I did not work out. I know I'll be fine. I'm going to be honest, I don't feel that I had a fair shot. I did all I could throughout high school to try to get in. I feel like my interview was not great. The person made me feel like I was just another obstacle in their day because they were short and curt and did not have a conversation with me during the interview like those described on numerous blogs; they just asked me a few questions and, which I tried to expand upon. They asked me whether I have questions about the admittance process and I tried to ask him questions about his point of view, but I felt that the conversation (which was the only one) went in a way that was unprofessional. Additionally, I felt like I had to shorten what I had to say just to fit the quality determining step that was the word count. I wrote the best essay I've written within the Common App, but was unable to fit within the 500 word count. Further, there was an unprecedented influx of applicants most and, from my point of view, had sub-par academic credentials that were cloaked by the guise of COVID; which prevented me from showing my prowess among others in the state of Texas due to the fact that all state meets were canceled. I tried sending in my progress, but all preliminary results were not available until this week... when decisions were about to be released. I come from a small town were opportunities like TMSCA and Olympiad were non-existent, so, despite my best, honest efforts, I was constantly boxed out until this year.</p><p>I know that this is probably going to be taken down, but I feel like it needs to be said. Thank you for your consideration.</p>

<p>valid. i am lucky that i actually enjoyed standardized tests (addicted to that dopamine). i hope you find in college that all your studying has prepared you well—a lot of the first two years might overlap a lot with what you've already learned, and you might have earned yourself some time coming up—during which you can do some more genuinely enjoyable and fulfilling things :)</p>

<p>Love you guys! I removed the MIT Admissions bookmark from my browser, but decided to type in the URL one last time just to see what wisdom Petey would throw at us. I'm glad I did. Although MIT would have been <i>really damn cool</i>, I knew it was a long shot from the beginning, haha.</p><p>Thank you AOs for chugging through all those applications to somehow still meet that Pi day deadline (I noticed a certain silence from AOs on the blogs and social media..). Thank you to the bloggers who kept me entertained with some <i>really</i> good writing, wisdom, and fun life stories. Thank you MIT for being the best-in-class but still caring.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, Lydia, appreciate it. the studying really was just a show for college admissions, though (it continues to be, as I'm waiting on other schools). I love learning and I study on my own time for things that are unrelated to school. School studying is drudgery and a complete waste of time (for me). So was taking the SAT.</p>

<p>unfortuately I don't have the incredible gift of optimism that the rest of you do. Getting rejected sucks, there's no other way to put it.</p><p>Would have appreciated the rejection letter without the patronizing mistruth "this decision doesn't reflect on you as a student or a person". the whole point is that you're judging us as students and people to determine who would be the best for the school. Talk about adding insult to injury. It's a failure on our part. No use in trying to "make things better" or whatever with such dishonesty.</p><p>Genuine congratulations to everyone who was admitted - it's quite the accomplishment, and it's very disappointing to know I won't be able to work and live alongside you in college. I've been waiting over six years for the opportunity to go to MIT because ever since setting foot on the campus I knew it would have been the best place for me. too bad I blew it. wish I had all the time back that I wasted studying in order to good grades. I could have used that time for actual learning instead, or at least something remotely fulfilling.</p><p>P.S. please, switch over to the common application so future students don't have to suffer through the ridiculously restrictive MIT custom application. 40 words to describe our activities just doesn't cut it, especially since there were only four spaces. No sense of depth, personality, or anything could possibly be contained in such a pitifully small amount of space.</p><p>don't got much left at this point, at least I'm still a big boy.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!! Getting rejected from MIT surprisingly did not hurt as much as I thought it would. Just like Waly said in the "Deferred Thoughts" blog post, after getting deferred, I saw myself finally considering other schools and appreciating how much other schools had to offer. I'm really happy that I've finally come to a place where I'm perfectly content with going to one of my strong target schools rather than MIT. This school will forever hold a place in my heart, but I just wasn't meant to spend the next four years here, and that's okay.</p>

<p>it's a bit of a weird place for me. you always hear about those ones whose life dream has been attending MIT. i fell in love with this school AFTER i applied. i had read some of the blogs before, but i had never <i>read</i> the blogs. but even before then the application itself resonated with me. the layout, the aesthetic, how easily you guys allow us to portray our own humanity as long as we take the chance to do so.</p><p>MIT has been my favorite application by far, and despite the decision, im glad i chose to do it in the end because i never would've discovered the blogs that so authentically portray what it means to be human: the passions, the despair, the excitement, the stress, and of course the friendships. completing that application, i dont even feel like the same person i was in august of last year. MIT has ignited a within me a passion to achieve and i didnt even have to attend the school!</p><p>thank you AOs for all of your work; i know it couldn't have been easy this year. thank you for everyone that blogs and makes this institution so unique. i will always keep an eye out for some more great advice as i continue my own path.</p>

<p>Hi. Not admitted here, but I'm perfectly at peace with that? How? Why? I'm not sure, but perhaps it has been because of the intense detachment I've had with the idea of university - especially MIT - over the past year.</p><p>I know a lot of us have wanted to go to MIT since we were in middle school, obsessed with what it represents. MIT is an incredibly powerful symbol - it has reached tens of thousands of bright students such as yourself as a beacon of knowledge that inspires and enlightens. That's how I felt about it, and still do to some extent.</p><p>After conversations with alumni, research about more universities, and more time spent in the sobering realities of the world, I've realised that this is a somewhat rosy, romanticised idea.</p><p>What is a university anyway? A bunch of buildings, maybe. Few groups of smart people here and there. Books, classes, clubs.</p><p>Why do we want to go there? Learn stuff. Meet people. Work on projects together. Understand ourselves.</p><p>Who do we want to be? World-changers. Academics. Engineers. Builders, explorers, knowers.</p><p>I'm sure my 4:00 AM answers to these questions don't even begin to express how you feel about MIT, but do you really believe it is the only place in the world to experience, realize, and achieve any of those things? When you strip away the ideas and symbols surrounding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, do you really feel the same way about this particular set of buildings, books, and classes?</p><p>You're joined by thirty one thousand incredibly bright minds who are in the same position as you, looking at a letter that indicates a closed door. I know that it can feel like more than that, but that's all it is. One opportunity out of THOUSANDS that is momentarily ducking its head. Who knows where you'll find the set of buildings, books, and classes that's perfect for you?</p><p>Regardless of how you feel and regardless of your admissions decision, my heart goes out to every one of you beautiful brains reading this message. Remember, you are yet to find the buildings in which you'll do everything you've ever wanted to. Or rather, those buildings are yet to find you. We will survive!</p>

And to everyone here that is down in the dumps, this is just one tiny smudge in the grand scheme of your whole life. Not being accepted does not mean your future career and everything you want is destroyed, if anything, it means you are going to get a whole new, unexpected way of pursuing your passions. By doing that, you may truly come to find the field you love and want to explore your entire life. Remember to always be nice to everyone (and I mean everyone, even the people that cut in front of lines) and to roll with the punches. Everyone here is going to do great things, I just know it.</p><p>Also, this blog post here: <a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmitadmissions.org%2Fblogs%2Fentry%2Fdenied-by-mit-5-years-later%2F%3APEeRuV1yZnKhMrF7KMNgiNEZXqU&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/denied-by-mit-5-years-later/">https://mitadmissions.org/b...</a> was great, do check it out :)</p>

<p>Well, I have nothing else than say thank you for all, MIT were for far the best admissions process ever, the most human and the most respectful in my opinion. I tried my best and I'm proud of it, and if you weren't admitted don't be sad about it just take in mind how many people would have the courage to do what we did. C ya ;)</p>

<p>Goodbye hopes and dreams. To the people that attend MIT and respond to these chats, I know you'll say good luck somewhere else or that this is not the end of the road, but that is a bit biased as you were accepted. To everyone that was accepted, be grateful. To those like me, take the pain, it will get worse before getting better. I wish you all the best of luck in life whether it's short or long.</p>

<p>I’m here early this time! Haha! I realized earlier today that it’s Pi day, and I thought I’d leave some words as someone that was in your spot two years ago. I was down in the dumps for quite a while. You may be able to relate to some of the thoughts I had:</p><p>“I viscerally feel the need to rewind time.”<br>“I felt like this place was where I truly belonged.”<br>“I don’t know how I can fix this.”</p><p>They’re honestly a bit melodramatic looking back, but I understand why I (and perhaps you) thought this. You’ve been working for a long time on your #1 goal for years, and right now, you feel like you fell short. There were a lot of strong-willed people in the comments of my thread who were immediately able to respond positively to the news, but I wasn’t and I’m still not someone like this. I needed a lot of time to process news I didn’t want to hear. If that’s you, I’d recommend giving yourself the time you need to do just that. What do I recommend?</p><p>Do something you love. Get away from this stress for a while. Take a walk, play video games, or learn a new hobby. I’d recommend rollerblading :) It will get better, even if you feel like it won’t, or you’d rather try and “fix” (scary word) the past than want to deal with your (likely rad) future.</p><p>What do I not recommend? Hanging out in these threads for a few hours like I did. I don't think it'll help your mood.</p><p>As for that future that seems so uncertain. You’ve probably read it a million times on this blog, but there isn’t one set path for you. It may seem like there was, or you only wanted a single path, but unfortunately, life isn’t that simple for pretty much everyone. However, it may not be as persuasive when you’re reading it from people who did achieve the dream you wanted so badly. Well ... firstly they’re correct and the world/people are more complicated than I believed when I was an HS senior, but secondly, I can give some insight that agrees with what they’ve written as someone who fell on the other side of the decision.</p><p>The good news is that all the skills you’ve picked up to give yourself the best shot possible will serve you well in the future. I initially felt a sense of dread going to a university I didn’t envision myself going to, but it turned out to be such an amazing experience. I’m majoring in my two favorite subjects (CS + Math B) ) just like I dreamed of doing. I’m doing research under amazing professors in a field I love just like I wrote about doing in my application. I’m getting the awesome experience to teach as a teaching assistant just like I wanted to. More valuable than anything are the people I’ve met. They’re brilliant, hilarious, crazy, insightful, bewildering, remarkable, scary, and sometimes annoying just like the people I’d picture I’d meet at MIT. They’ve humbled and helped me to steer in the direction I need for what I’d like for my future.</p><p><a href="https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.discordapp.com%2Fattachments%2F294282012146139147%2F674845741113671702%2F20200205_225903.jpg%3A7nwPgCK4TO4AKlly1YFx8Hkvb28&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/294282012146139147/674845741113671702/20200205_225903.jpg">Actually most importantly, just like I pictured at MIT, there’s snow every year!</a></p><p>Yes, I’m somehow going 2/2 for snow in Texas.</p><p>My main point is that everything you loved MIT for can be found at other universities excluding the Frank Ghery buildings. You may not agree with me now, but as long as you apply yourself just like you have been to get to his point then I’m very confident you’ll find the same experience as me.</p><p>Overall, I wrote a lot here that you probably don’t want to read, but my main idea is that everything will, in fact, be okay. Shocker! Everything you love about the university you’ll be able to find wherever you go, so do what you need to shake off those hard feelings to deal with, and look forward to a fun path ahead of you. In-person college is an amazing experience, and I can’t wait for you to get to jump into the fun soon.</p><p>It’s not like you have to disavow the university (like my mom did lol) or forget about it. There’s plenty of experiences you may have obtained from the place that’ll serve you well going forward. I’ll be applying again in a few years as MIT is one of many great places that will help me with my future goals, and I imagine many of you will find yourself in the same spot a few years from now. However, unlike in high school, it’s because MIT happens to be one of many places that will help me in doing the things I love. Likewise, I’d advise you to focus on yourself above everything. Do things that you find fun. Find happiness for the sake of your own well-being. Make the most of your time and the place you live. At the end of the day, it’s all you can really do. If your dream school happens to be a route you find in the future of the path you’re on, then great. If it doesn’t, then that’s also fantastic.</p>
