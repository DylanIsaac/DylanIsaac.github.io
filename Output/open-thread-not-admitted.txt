<p>Hi!</p><p>I wasn't planning on posting here, but what the heck? I could use some ventilation now.</p><p>I really wanted to go to MIT, especially since the last 2 months. It was never my dream college until like 5 weeks ago when I read Ben's blog "It's more than a job". Well, I was kinda expecting a rejection from the very start but there was always a tiny itsy bitsy glimmer of hope that maybe, MAYBE the admissions officers might make a mistake and admit me :P</p><p>The funny thing is: the more I read blogs from previous years which were aimed at consoling those who weren't admitted, the more I fell in love with MIT. The more often I read the phrase "MIT is just any other place", the more I was convinced that it ISN'T JUST ANY OTHER PLACE, IT'S SPECIAL!</p><p>Since childhood, I was never really hyped up about going to a 'fancy' college with a fancy name and a fancy ranking but as app season began and I started applying to colleges, I thought "MIT does sound fancy, and fancy is what I should get" .Finally as the days approached the decisions date, and Nigel Thornberry finally announced that the decisions will be released on pi day at tau time ET, I realized how much I'd fallen in love with these three syllables- EM AI TEE. I recalled all those times when my father told me that his dream was to see me at MIT (which until recently never got to my head why he was so obsessed). And I also recalled (unintentionally) all those times when my teachers said I should go to MIT because I was the best in class and MIT is the best university- what a match! they thought. Ptff!</p><p>The past week, I haven't had much sleep. I spent sleepless nights praying so that I get into MIT. Also, now I realize how pitiful I must have sounded when I went around desperately asking people to pray for me- so that I get in. In one week's time I had forwarded the message "MIT decisions in one week. This means the world to me at the moment. Please pray for me" to at least 40 different people, most of whom I haven't spoke to in months. I'd asked my parents to ask their friends and family to pray. I'd asked my friends, their families, my teachers and their extended families, my father's friends' friends, my mother's relatives and their relatives, my friend's aunt's son-in-law's girlfriend's mother and so on...!</p><p>Yesterday, as I stared at the clocked, counting down to the last second, something dawned upon me- I remembered my own explanation to the cliched saying "what ever happens, happens for the best". My explanation (truncated to 2 sentences) is that whatever I choose will become the best, because I've chosen it. My decision just happened, and after all we're assuming the constant is- whatever happens, happens for the best. So why not, if rejected from MIT, chose something else, and know that since I've chosen it, is why it is best for me? Yes, I know it's not that easy to choose what or whom to fall in love with. But I will try :)</p><p>I was denied. DUH! But I didn't cry much. I thought I would cry incessantly for at least a week, but I didn't and hopefully, wont. I had the audacity to  go to my mom, wake her from sleep, and tell her that I was rejected even when she was expecting to hear good news. I told my friends and families that I was rejected and I even sent a text message to my favorite teacher (by the way, I live in UAE, so it was 2.28 am when I received the decision). Finally, I got some sleep, after 4 days- ironic much?</p><p>Today, I've been getting sorry looks and "are you alrite?" and "everything's gona be fine" messages and IMs. To them I reply, politely (and in my head :P ) - "Yes, I know :)"</p><p>Sure it would be amazing to go to MIT but it's okay, you know? Sorry, but I am about to throw the most cliched console-phrase ever:  we don't have to go to MIT, to be successful in life.</p><p>Lastly I would like to thank the admissions officers for spending so much time and effort evaluating my application. <br> <br>Congratulations to everyone! <br>To the admitted; for getting an offer from one the most selective colleges in the world, to the wait-listed; for getting a second shot and to the ones denied; for getting a chance to introspect :)</p><p>Take care!<br></p>

<p>To all rejectees: Keep your head up because there are worse things than being rejected at MIT. At least all of you have a safety school, it's not like you won't get accepted anywhere! Unfortunately, i'm an international student from a third world country who needs full financial aid, so my chances of admission are slimmer at 'lesser schools'! As I can't afford university education (even in my country) without a scholarship, every rejection letter means that I might not be able to continue my education. And as for MIT, well I guess the rejection made me regret I ever applied; the expenses for the application process could have been used to feed my family for 3 months :(... </p>

<p>My daughter did not get in and I am disappointed for her and for myself. It is really tough after building up all that hope and all the paperwork and all. Getting into MIT is like winning the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, but the sun did come up today, as it will tomorrow. My advice to her is "to have been considered is itself an achievement"; am sure she will get into another awesome school, and will still consider MIT for grad school.</p><p>I am just writing this comment for its therapeutic value of "letting things out" - the bottom line here is that parents are equally affected.</p><p>I guess the admissions staff did the best they could.  I enjoyed the blogs, and will probably keep returning to this site.  It is what it is...life-after-not-getting-into-MIT-goes-on.</p>

Kind of hurts. What SAT scores were needed to get in ? I'm not Putin, I cannot do better than 800 in Physics. I know MIT was a top notch school, but I'm impressed by the level. Besides, I think the rejection letter should go as following : <br>"Dear X,<br>We know you're a great person. You probably do know it too. But at least 1,800 persons are greater than you, or deserve to go to MIT more than you do. If you really wanted to go to MIT, you should have lived in the US, since we are really being easier with people who live on our soil. Maybe then you would have been accepted. Go on and have a wonderful life."</p><p>Anyway, life goes on !</p>

<p>Hey all,<br>It's tough isn't it? I think I speak for all of us when I say that no admissions official, no admitted student, no one except someone who's been rejected can really know how we feel.</p><p> I only decided to apply to MIT around August of 2011, really late in the game when I come to think of it. I had never dreamed of applying as an undergrad until a friend mentioned to me that I might have the potential needed to study at MIT. From then till now, it's been a frenzy of dreams, dreams of studying at MIT, dreams of doing research at MIT,  dreams of taking part in the Boston music scene (I'm a musician as well), and dreams of how great my future would be if I was accepted.</p><p> It was amazing guys. Such wonderful possibilities revealed themselves to me. MIT would be a way to a better life, a life that I could use to make the world a better place. I imagined learning science in a way that I had never thought possible, gaining such a thorough understanding of the subjects that I would actually be able to teach anyone everything that I had been taught. I love teaching, I love helping people understand things that they find difficult, and MIT represented a utopia of knowledge where I would be able to hone that skill to perfection.<br> <br>So with all this inspiration, I filled out my application honestly and I wrote my essays with all the passion that I could convey into words. I poured my heart and soul into those essays. I tried my best to show the Admissions Committee who I am and what I'm all about. I wrote my SATs to the best of my ability and I was able to get pretty decent scores. All in all, I think I did the best that I possibly could.</p><p>And after all that, I was rejected.<br> <br>I stayed up all night to check my results (it was at 5 am here in India), and I watched a video just before I entered my username and password into the decisions page:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F30449978%3A-AQlxeva8cUATp68t4HQm6qHEZI&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://vimeo.com/30449978">http://vimeo.com/30449978</a></p><p> This video gave me hope guys. It actually made it seem possible that someone who's passionate about what they do could actually get accepted into MIT, and moreover feel at home there.<br>This hope was a double edged sword. While I loved it because of the possibilities which it presented, I hated it because of the disappointment and heartbreak it brought on Pi day.<br> <br>I typed in my username and password on the decisions page and clicked 'Display Decision'. Rejected. Wow. I don't think it really hit me then. After that I went to bed as I was really tired after a nearly 12 hour vigil. I woke up some 4 hours later and the reality washed over me. And for the first time in nearly 6 years, I cried. My dream was dead. All the plans, all the wonderful plans that I'd had, gone, just like that.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day moping around, too depressed to do anything. And then about 2 hours ago I went on YouTube and watched this video:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_Z5OookwOoY%3AsOmbzJXeROSbCCNc8onu89ap9i8&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z5OookwOoY">http://www.youtube.com/watc...</a></p><p>And also, for some reason, this video:</p><p><a href="http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzlfKdbWwruY%3Afv6bVoKShJNwWLKmsak-PZS-V6Q&amp;cuid=1100303" rel="nofollow noopener" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlfKdbWwruY">http://www.youtube.com/watc...</a></p><p>After watching these two videos (the first one in particular) I realized that it was'nt MIT that had me so excited. It was the realization of my own purpose in life. Through this application process, I finally realized what I want to do with my life. I now know what my passions really are and how I want to pursue them in the future. I know that I want to make the world a better place and I have a pretty good idea as to how I can do that. This knowledge is extremely valuable. I'm not going to go so far as to say that it was worth being rejected just to learn all this, but it was definitely worth the physical, mental, and emotional work and effort that I put into my application.</p><p>Now I don't know how you guys plan to cope with rejection. But let me tell you what I'm going to try to do, and what I hope all of you will try to do as well. I'm going to take this experience and make it a positive one. I'm going to work towards my goals like a man possessed. I'm going to make sure that I don't have the opportunity to blame anyone or anything for my failures, and the only way to do that is to make sure that I don't fail. Because in all honesty, we can sit here complaining about the Admissions Board being biased and the decisions being unfair all day. But that will not change the outcome. What's done is done and there's nothing we can do about it. We must accept what has happened and keep striving towards our goals.</p><p>MIT was never the goal guys. Happiness is the goal. While MIT might've made happiness a little bit easier to obtain, that doesn't mean that we can't get there otherwise. The fact that you even applied makes you special, and among the smartest individuals in the world. If all of us work hard enough to make this world a better place, just think of the possibilities. The dream is still alive.</p><p>I'm not going to give up on MIT though. I'm going to apply again. I may apply as a transfer student, or as a graduate student. I'm going to show MIT that I deserve to be a student there, that I deserve to be a part of that community. And I intend to work as hard as humanly possible to do so.</p><p>But in the end, it doesn't matter where you go to college. It's what you choose to do with the opportunities available to you that makes all the difference.</p><p>So keep your chins up guys. It may be a bit hard right now, but I know it'll get better. And I know that each and every one of us is destined for great things.</p><p>P.S. Thanks to the Admissions Committee for all the hard work that you put into the admissions process. And congratulations to all students of the Class of 2016! Make sure that you utilize this opportunity to the best of your ability and always remember that there are thousands of people that would do anything to have the privilege to study at this wonderful Institute.</p><p>P.P.S.  @The Admissions Committee : Maybe you should consider getting a rejected student to write a blog post. I mean you can have a million accepted students write sympathetic posts but it just isn't the same. I realize this is a bit impractical, but it's just a thought.<br>Also, please try to increase the word limits on the essays. It's really hard to convey your entire message in 500 words or less. I sure had trouble condensing it that much. Again, just a suggestion. :)</p><p></p>

<p>Further to my previous message.... I am not doubting MIT education system. It is all about the admission process which should be transparent enough so that no doubts / dissatisfactions are genrated.</p>

<p>To All those rejected and to the admission staff---<br>I dont know why such a cry for an institute like MIT which has got the most Obscure and Vague admission system which is not at all transparent. This can surely be a reson for all malpractices related to admission process. If they are so honest, why can't they provide reasons for rejection or atleast a grading / rating scale comparing least deserving applicant who has been admitted to MIT with the person who is rejected.<br>Their admission process is totally subjective which cannot be authenticated. It is always a risk of jection even for the most deserving candidate of thee universe as nothing can be authenticated in case of MIT admission.</p>

<p>It's been 3 hours and something minutes since I received my rejection letter, but as many of you have previously stated, life does go on. MIT was an still is a great place to have a dream and built upon it if the chance is given, but that doesn't mean I'm going to still do something amazing in life. I'm pretty sure God has something better in store for me. I'm not defeated, I'm not lost, I'm not going to commit any nonsense for this event in my life. If you have bruises get up and keep walking. Anyways, I'll apply again as a transfer student and even for graduate school. Who knows I might get in, or maybe I won't, but I'm not going to stop giving 200% of passion in what I love to do. I wish the best of luck to all of you on your lives. Don't give up. Breathe, laugh, and turn to the next page. College is what you make out of it. I wish all of you the best.</p>

<p>Guys, Life still goes on. You are perfect and you know it. No matter where you will be accepted I am sure you are able to fight for your dreams. I had perfect scores in everything, won several science competitions in my home country, took part in world science competitions as well and founded the company that now supports my family. But I was rejected. That means this year it was really hard for Admissions Committee to choose. Therefore, Don't waste your precious time and think about your future as an undergraduate student without MIT( or at least think that you may transfer). I am sure it hurts ( some of you have spent years dreaming about MIT), but it is the best way. Prove yourself and the world that You can be among the best no matter what! :)</p>

<p>Not true.  My son was also rejected.  He got a perfect 2400 on the SAT (single sitting).  His GPA is 4.6 weighted, 3.9 unweighted.  He's ranked 13/806 in his class and has many AP classes completed as well as in progress.  He's an Eagle Scout.  I read his essays and thought they were excellent, although it's hard to be eloquent in only 250 words.  I saw his recommendations.  They were superb.</p><p>He was immensely disappointed to be rejected from his top school, but he's getting over it.  Happily he applied to many schools (16 in all) and has gotten the nod from a handful already, and there are others with decisions still to come.</p><p>And as I told him, there's always grad school....<br>PS Caltech rejected him as well.</p>

<p>I'm not going to GA Tech, but.....<br>I agree with you. My counselor was having a conversation with someone else while I was filling out my application saying "....first person in NINE YEARS to apply....", and whenever I would say I have a lower chance of getting in because of not being able to take all recommended courses, someone else would say "but STILL..."<br>Except for your opinion on your SAT scores. It's really hypocritical of me to say so since I've said the same thing myself, but I realized that passing 2000, even if it's only by 10, IS a milestone after hearing juniors in AP Bio amazed at it. </p>

<p>I never really expected to get into Ivies or top schools like MIT and Stanford because I never felt qualified enough. But I applied to them anyways just to know that "I tried" :). Last saturday, I got into CalTech. I was literally in disbelief because I never really thought I was "crazy" enough to get in. That acceptance sort of boosted my spirits that maybe I might get into MIT as well, but today I got rejected. BUT I'm totally fine with it. Admissions at MIT knows what they're doing, and to be quite frank, I don't even know how I got into CalTech LOL. I didn't do research, win national/international competitions, and I don't have 99th percentile test scores or grades.</p><p>I think the only thing I do have to say is that perhaps, it had a lot to do with the record number of applicants this year. MIT got 18K apps. They usually get 10-12k apps, so their acceptance rate ends up around 10-11%. However, this year, the acceptance rate ended up being around 8.9% because of the number of apps. BUT then again, I'm fine. I read the blogs and those of the admissions officers, and I know they put their heart and soul into deciding who gets the nod, so I am proud of their efforts anyway.</p><p>I was hoping that maybe I would get into MIT because there is this stereotype that CalTech is full of nerds and socially awkward people. To be honest, I don't want to spend 4 years of my life with those kind of people. BUT I will soon find out for myself if that stereotype holds true this coming April at Prefrosh Weekend. I know MIT students play hard and work hard, so I felt like maybe MIT would be the place for me :).</p><p>All this being said, I know God has a plan for me, and that this is fate.</p><p>Good Luck to all and hopefully today isn't the "end of the world" because you got rejected from MIT.</p><p>Best,<br>cerritoskid (you can find me on the caltech cc thread ;] )</p>

<p>It's strange, but I had come to an acceptance of whatever happens, happens for a while. I told myself that I would be fine no matter the decision, kind of expecting to be denied, but also expecting to make it. And it just felt great, knowing that I applied for what I, and of course many others, consider to be the best school, and to know that I might just have what it takes. Even better, was all my friends who were backing me up as well. Whenever my parents mentioned that I even applied to MIT to their friends, it would raise eyebrows.</p><p>So even with the either way attitude going in, all day was just nervous anticipation. People were asking me all day about how it went, of course this was before the decision was even out, too. So by the time the decision was finally released, I'm feeling pretty good, my attitude had shifted to belief that I would be accepted. Now, I'm posting here, so obviously I wasn't... and it kind of burns still... but, having thought about it for the last few hours, and especially with my shower epiphanies... you know it's not really the school that makes the people, it's the people that make the school. There were so many of us, and on many other years, we could have been the MIT caliber they were searching for, it just happens that we had such a competitive year. Knowing full well that you had the potential to go there, you should be able to succeed wherever, because you are one of the people who could have made the school as great as it is.</p><p>You know, I'm looking back, kind of thinking "is there something that I could have done to push my over the line?" Well, it's certainly possible, I probably could have improved my SAT scores (only 2010 &gt;.&gt; had trouble writing with the prompt), I probably could have joined some robotics team, or done Science Olympiad, maybe even kept in the Academic Bowl or joined the Math Team. But seriously considering it all, would it have worth it? For each thing I could have done, would definitely have impacted something I have done, and changed who I am. And frankly, I'm glad I didn't do any of those, I had fun with what I did do (swimming...band...acting). </p><p>Now I'll be going to GA Tech, thankfully I had such a good backup, being 3rd in Mechanical Engineering, but the dream hasn't really died. This may not be my year, but I still feel like I am MIT caliber, so in the future, I will definitely be trying again. The only thing that could beat undergrad at MIT, is Grad School at MIT.</p><p>Just my outlook on life.... through an essay that may be completely out of character for me. Internal images and external images can be so conflicting. </p><p>P.S. anyone else going the GA Tech?</p>

<p>Oh how the tears fall for me and those in my pain. Having dreams so vivid now they are gone to the rain. Once had hopes that my heart was attached, then rejection came and our hearts it snatched. It will never be easy to reset out thoughts. The thoughts of going to MIT. Years of hard work and determination to proceed to such a historic university. MIT oh MIT where else can we find a new heart. MIT I thank you for the program Splash, and those days and nights doing AP Math. I grew as a person trying to reach you. Trying to become that which is in you. Now no more these Grand thoughts of New. Just Pain, a void, a hole slowly growing and feeling no strain. I stress how can I hold my head up tonight after the war was lost. Using everything to my disposal no matter the cost. Researching my Summers away, letting my link between friends decay. MIT oh MIT where are you to hold my hand? To hold me steady while I shake with agony while the tears fall gently. I saw you, and there you were beautiful and majestic as if you were calling out to me. But now I know it was all a trick: Hoodwinked. Hopeless to be overcome with this feeling called fear as the shadows of failure lurk behind. A chance to grow? A chance to see whats left in time? But tomorrow isnt promised and neither was yesterday. But on the day of Pi I feel as though I have found one thing that trumps all other past emotions. This one thing is the pain of Rejection. Not rejection from a girl you thought was cute, a scholarship, or even a summer program. But from a school made only from your dreams: A dream school called MIT. Yet I say she shall only be a dream. A fantasy so it may seem. So for the rest of my life I will remember this day. Change the world, And have MIT to blame. Because of MIT the world will have cleaner air, more effective aircraft, and have created a Noble Prize winner. MIT oh MIT this must not be the end. For I shall come back maybe not as a student but as someone who has seen the world and came to show you that you could have claimed the credit. MIT oh MIT whose heart you made so heavy, I shall Fly above even your expectations and push myself far behind the average academic barrier. All to say to you that you broke what was not yours, and wont even try to fix it. My Dreams,Heart, and Will broken all in one swift motion. But you dont even care. For you MIT I wouldve made you proud, made you feel like there was no other place Id rather be, made you feel like i was truly in love with being a part of you. But now you throw me away like a broken toy and tell me to find a new home. A home that would take me and mold me into something that would not be truly complete. I wanted MIT to break me, but also build me back up to be stronger than I once was. Yet you laugh and only break me, forcing me to get up but I have yet to know if I can be stronger than I once was. MIT I was the bright green lantern but now I join the Red core. MIT oh MIT I loved you, no I still love you. But like the girls in my past you tell me that Im perfect but for somebody else. But I dont want to be with any other school except for you. Who am I kidding, this will go through your ears like the wind. Ignoring me as time goes by. Again this must be a trick to once again let me waste time. But I tried MIT, for you, for me, for those who said that you were just a fragment of my imagination and for the people who believed in me. I tred so hard MIT that the burdens I carried were too heavy to bear, but I did it to try and seek your magnifiance. MIT oh MIT in the future our paths will meet, over and over until one day you accept me for who I am and wont say to me again. "You're Perfect, but for Somebody else." But "You're Perfect for me." Then again no one is perfect and no one will. Perfection is just a myth a plague a way to get inside our minds. I will Rise like a Phoniex to become that which you will one day seek.

<p>I hate MIT for rejecting me and for killing my dream of studying engineering; I don't think that this school lives up to what it talks about. MIT consistently brags that it cares about 'fun' and how it is as important as gaining knowledge. However, MIT is just being hypocritical as it looks straight at an applicant's SAT score, GPA and academic performance before considering his/her accomplishments, thus, weighing scores more than passion.</p><p>MIT, thanks for showing me what you really are. You have truly opened my eyes. I used to dream of attending you, but not anymore. You have left me a sad, brokenhearted and skeptical man.</p>

<p>So... yeah. Rejected. Ouch, that hurt. Way more than CalTech did. (Of course, I was a lot more interested in MIT - largely because of these blogs, I might add) I'm not quite sure, but I really felt like I was going to get in, and when I saw the result... it was like a brick hitting me in the face. Then I started rationalizing. "They can't accept everyone, it's a ridiculously selective school, etc. etc." But then, I stated to wonder. Okay, I didn't make it, I can deal with that, I've got other plans. But... why? Was it the Bs I got last year? Surely a 2320 and 35 weren't the issue? My lack of community service or related activities? Essays, interview, recommendations, what? But I can't know, and that sucks.</p><p>But, there's still Harvey Mudd (any potential Mudders here?), and I got a free ride to Tulsa University (I live in Tulsa, and it's nationally ranked, so not a bad choice at all). I could even go the crazy route and go study Game Design at Neumont.</p><p>In any case, Congrats to those admitted, and sorry (really) for those others rejected. And good luck to everyone. It's not the end of the world, no matter how much it may feel that way.</p><p>-Brandon J. (Not '16)</p>

We have the same ACT score, Almost the same classes (I'm a year ahead in one subject and take an extra science, and I took music while he took film), very similar grades, almost identical GPA, both in the IB Diploma programme, Same amount of volunteering/community service, same amount of extracurricular activities, I think you get the point.

Take a year off from school, and work and travel and try new things and such, and apply again next year - to MIT, but to other schools as well.

<p>I'm sure everyone here is exhibiting the Kubler-Ross model of the 5 Stages of Grief:</p><p>Denial- This must be a mistake!  There's no way I got rejected by MIT!</p><p>Anger- THIS IS ABSURD!!! ABSOLUTELY UNFAIR AND UNACCEPTABLE!!!</p><p>Bargaining- Please... Is there any way for me to appeal?... I swear, if I get another chance to prove my worthiness of MIT, I'll try my very best and put in 120% of my maximum effort (despite it being physically impossible) year round in extracurricular activities, research projects, and leadership positions in addition to outstanding academics.</p><p>Depression-  *sob*  *sob*  I'm a failure, I couldn't meet up to my expectations...  *sniff*  I'm just second-rate after all... unable to compete with the stellar elite who royally deserve this honor...  Perhaps I'm not even adequate material after all... just a wannabe nerd alongside all the real innovative scientists of our next generation.</p><p>Acceptance-  Maybe I wasn't meant to go to MIT... Maybe I'm better off going to another university that would be glad to accept me for who I am.  Who knows, maybe if I did get accepted, by the slimmest margins, I would have failed due to the insurmountable stress and intensity of the curriculum and classwork that I just wasn't capable of handling, as of now....  I'm sure God, or some supernatural being that I worship, may have deemed it necessary that I get rejected at MIT, and that perhaps there was a greater purpose for this rejection as to lay the pathway for me to get into another university where I would work towards my ultimate story of success.  Or... this could just be the unfortunate result of Murphy's Law and that I'm just finally over the grief and ready to move on.<br></p>

<p>I'm disappointed, of course, but I made it easier on myself by telling myself all day today that there was no chance I was going to be accepted - that way, if I was accepted, I'd be more ecstatic, and less crushed if I was denied admission.</p><p>It's frustrating, though. I never expected to fall in love with a school like MIT - I'm a humanities person! I didn't even like science and math until last year, and then I had a great teacher and realized STEM stuff was awesome, and had to start making up for lost time... I applied and was deferred EA, and then denied RA. I've struggled a lot with anxiety and depression in the past four years, and I have to wonder - maybe if I hadn't struggled as much with them - maybe if I'd had more energy, forced myself to do more even past the apathy - maybe if I'd tried just a little bit harder - maybe I wouldn't be sitting here wondering why. I know I'm an excellent student. I have good scores, yes, but beyond that I simply love to learn, and any teacher - anyone around me, actually - will tell you that, because I will drop anything for learning. Not necessarily in a specific field - just learning. I love to learn, need it like I need to breathe, and the environment at MIT, with all that energy and passion for learning and the different fields? It was the first time I felt truly, completely, at home, when I visited.</p><p>I've been strongly considering taking a gap year, though, and this just makes it more likely. Take a gap year. Travel the country - see D.C., and NYC, and Portland, and St. Louis, and so on. Volunteer in another country teaching English. Work in a lab. Work at my parent's store. Do awesome things, so that whatever college I end up going to, I get to bring even more awesome experiences. And, in the meantime, mature more emotionally. I know that, honestly, I'm not fully ready for college emotionally right now, and definitely not MIT. I still struggle too much with anxiety. So I can work on that during this year, and next year, not have that holding me back as much. I can re-apply to MIT next year, as well as to any other colleges I want, assuming I don't accept admission into another college this year (I've only heard back from MIT and Robert E. Cook Honors college at Indiana University in Pennsylvania - accepted - this year so far, though). We'll see.</p><p>But whatever happens, I'll take whatever is given to me and give back 150%.</p>

<p>I'm not that surprised either, since I couldn't take physics (why couldn't the superintendent that said a class will be offered as long as students want it come a few months earlier!), but despite rejection, I still think MIT is awesome because...<br>1) I managed to mostly get rid of a mental block I developed during Calculus AB last year after talking about it during my interview, so I'm doing fairly well in BC and now believe I AM capable of learning new material. <br>2) Rejection isn't so bad since we can all talk about it together, so now I can move on and just concentrate on preparing for Festival of Gold (whereas the other colleges I applied to release decisions right before tour, or during tour, so I'll HAVE to force myself to ignore them until after performing). <br>If I feel the same way in a few months, I WILL keep on trying, as a transfer applicant. And, thank you for taking time to review my application. I guess I'll now write another thank you note to my EC for #1, and also explain why I couldn't describe playing in Carnegie Hall during my interview...</p>

<p>Don't worry, Kit.  I wasn't admitted last year.  <br>It hurts for a bit, for sure (okay, more than a bit in my case), but it gets better.  It was a learning experience for me.  Just remember: you have a fire inside which pushed you to apply (and is part of who you are) -- don't let yourself neglect that fire.  Keep it with you, focus it, twist it, bend it, tweak it, make it grow, and it will help you wherever you go, whatever you decide to do.Being awesome is something done by you, not the school you go to.</p><p>Too, many, commas, I, KNOW -- hopefully I made sense.:)</p>

<p>I can't even describe how much pain I'm in now. For the past month, I dreamed of getting admitted. Boston is a second home to me, since most of my family lives there. I dreamed of riding my bike through Cambridge, suffering through psets, working in the neuroscience lab at MIT, and having the privilege of calling myself an MIT student. Now that's all gone, and I don't even know where I'm going. So far, I've been rejected at CalTech, waitlisted at Washington University in St. Louis, and accepted at a small liberal arts school three miles from my house. All through my four years in high school, I dealt with a horrific family situation. The only thing that let me go forward and not sink in despair was the prospect of going to an excellent university far from home (Cleveland) where I could study neuroscience passionately and try to leave my past behind to become a success. I know I can always achieve that somewhere else, and I'll have to look forward from here and shake off the despair. MIT really became part of me during the application process. It feels as though a little piece of my heart is gone. I am still yet to hear from Stanford, Harvard, NYU, Columbia, Johns Hopkins and Penn. Whatever happens, I hope I get accepted at one of them.</p><p>In the end, thanks to the whole admissions staff. You took the time to read my application, interview me, and make a hard decision about my admission. I know that wherever I go, I'll be successful. </p>

<p>Wow, what an amazing day. My sympathies go out to all who were declined admission. I am sure that you are a great bunch of people. My congratulations to those who had the privilege of being accepted. Be humble, and enjoy your time there. I also was not admitted, but I refuse to cry about it! However - @Never stop trying - I refuse to be so cold about it. I was declined admission, not because MIT wasn't good enough to have me, but because there were so many other people better suited for the positions. @Victor Iringere, I agree: God does know best. I might not be going to MIT...but I have been accepted and offered the top academic scholarship to a fabulous Christian college in California. For a country boy from the "Land Down Under," that's just great. All the best everyone. Have a great life!</p>

<p>Hey don't forget - this doesn't mean anything's going to be different in your future. If you love science and math and engineering, you're going to be crazy awesome at it, no matter where you are. Also, I just want to point out that a lot of the most brilliant and amazing professors and researchers at MIT didn't even go there for undergad. Wherever you go for the next four years - that's where you're probably going to meet your best friend or the love of your life. :P You're going to hear this a thousand times, but you're going to have to listen eventually: keep your chin up, and do everything the best you can. If you want to change the world, you'll do it!</p><p>When your parents get up tomorrow, just tell them that MIT's not gonna happen, but tell them that you know you're going to work hard to achieve whatever you want anyway. My advice: look at the colleges that accepted you, read up on their traditions and campus, and get super excited for the next four year of your life! :)</p>

<p>Thanks Harine. Just can't stop the tears. Maybe I shouldn't build my whole dreams based on MIT.<br>I'll be fine. Thanks for the comment.</p>

<p>The least you could have done was view the video I send in on my midyear report -- it was a minute long.</p>

<p>So this sort of sucks. I've wanted to go to MIT for years, but I guess I can always just </p>

<p>Oh well. Congratulations to all of you who got admitted, I'm sure you'll have a great time. So will I, of course, just not at MIT.</p><p>It is of course bitter to not get in to your first choice, but when aiming at a school like MIT it is a possibility one has to prepare for.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who was involved with the process! Although I didn't get admitted, I learned a lot about myself and the world.</p>

Never stop trying
<p>Lol  <a data-dsq-mention="gelare:disqus" href="https://disqus.com/by/Gelare/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://disqus.com/by/Gelare/">Gelare</a> ,<a data-dsq-mention="as:disqus" href="https://disqus.com/by/AS/" rel="nofollow noopener" title="https://disqus.com/by/AS/">AS</a> ,<br> .. What a bunch of babies. Just move on. "wahh wahh i didnt get what i wanted". I didn't either. And to be honest, it's staggering thinking about that 7/8 of the people who didn't get accepted, and that this is probably the first time in their entire life they didn't get what they wanted. And i bet they're boo-hooing and whining to their mommys about it. You know what? I tried, I failed, I move on.    I suggest you don't wallow in self-pity and just go make the most of yourselves wherever you go.</p>

<p>I have to say, I was really hoping. Seriously truly hoping to attend MIT. </p><p>But, the numbers are against me, and I won't be attending. </p><p>I cried... yes, I cried, but I've got offers elsewhere. I can't cry over one opportunity. </p><p>Well, MIT, you were a good dream. You won't be able to claim me when I go into the real world and change it for the better. But that's okay. </p><p>Adieu.</p>

<p>Rejected. AS, there's no appeals process; if one existed, they would have to turn away someone who was accepted. I don't begrudge anyone who did get in, for their most surely richly deserve it. We're all upset, but we'll make it through.</p>

<p>Oh well. I wasn't expecting to be admitted, but it doesn't make it any less soul destroying. Anyone else firmed University of Edinburgh (in Scotland) instead? Not very likely I'll find anyone on here, but it's worth a shot. </p>
