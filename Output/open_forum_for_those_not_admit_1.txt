<p>Thanks for not accepting me. I just received news from three honors colleges that I&#8217;ve been accepted, and they&#8217;re all offering me $136,000 for four years. So I say, in your face! I don&#8217;t need an MIT education to succeed. Besides, one of those colleges is near D.C. Where I want to be if I want to work for the government.

<p>I&#8217;m an international student, had every hope and so many projects for M.I.T, and I know I would have contributed so well in every aspect, not just academically. If the admission committee know our applications so well, I would really appreciate if they could just write a few lines about why we weren&#8217;t admitted in the rejection letter. Wouldn&#8217;t cost much, they&#8217;d just had to write a little note before they throw the file in the &#8220;not admitted&#8217; pile.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spent a hell of a time for these applications, I dreamed, I had mixed feelings, I was hopeless and hopeful, I wanted to make my family proud&#8230;for those admitted, be happy with your decision, it&#8217;s a lifetime chance for you, don&#8217;t keep saying u hate MIT; thousands would have liked to be admitted like you. But if you still hate M.I.T so much, then it puts me in great doubt of the admissions committee; they&#8217;ve actually admitted people who hate and do not want to attend M.I.T and rejected thousands who love MIT and would do anything to attend. Food for thought there&#8230;admissions committee, thank you for all. But you are humans, and you do make mistakes. I think next time in the applications for the future, add a question saying: &#8220;Do you really want to attend M.I.T?&#8221; lol&#8230;anyway would be great if you could remove those who are admitted but who hate M.I.T and give their place to students who actually want to attend.</p>
<p>My best of luck and hope to all those rejected like me. It was my lifetime dream, I could see myself there. But now, I just have to move on, my parents will be disappointed and I&#8217;ll have to face the look in their eyes.</p>
